(It took me some time to write this as you may have already added stuff, or there could be stuff already there I missed in the first place)

May I.....  Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) 

You have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced """"""""welder"""""""", save for I'm sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven't been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  

HOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I've read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can't stand things which don't come up in google counts.

The list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of """"""""authoritative"""""""" sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a """"""""school of thought"""""""" on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything """"""""so they say"""""""".  

X-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.

A highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.

This largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki's undoing.   

From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating """"""""duty-cycle"""""""") to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a 'shortness' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to """"""""wick"""""""" (conduct) heat away from the p",0,Wikipedia

Mick I think knows this subject more than I do, although I am more or less one of the major (at least frequent, anyway) editors relating to religion and Christianity.

There are also a variety of Jewish Christian groups, although there is no evidence Dylan belonged to a group that has been described as such. This subject has been extensively discussed before, and in fact led to an editor being banned at one point. He did achieve a great deal of press coverage, and thus notability, for the albums he issued during his """"""""Christian"""""""" period, and it is seems on that basis that his """"""""Christianity"""""""" be noted. As he has never conclusively subsequently officially renounced any form of Christianity, there is a good chance WP:BLP might enter into our moving him into Category:Former Christians or anything like that, because he has never himself that I know of described himself unequivocally in such terms. In short, this is still a matter of some ambiguity about the subject, particularly taking BLP into account, and I think the current categorization schema was arrived at after those really lengthy, and frankly extremely contentious, discussions. And we really don't have a category of Category:People who have been described as both Jewish and Christian, so this seems to be, basically, the only way to go.

 Proposed Edits to New 'Section 3.1' - Timeline, 1875-1925 

1885–1924: The origin of IBM
 Year  Gross Income (in $m)  Employees 1890   1895   1900   1905   1910   1915  4  1,672 1920  14  2,731 1925  13  3,698
 
The roots of IBM date back the the 1880s, decades before the development of electronic computers. The company was formed through a merger of three different companies: the Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. in the 1880s), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Corporation (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA)..  The merger was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint, and the new company was called the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) CorporationMartin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer a History of the Information Machine — Second Edition, Westview Press, pages 37–39 2004. CTR was incorporated on June 16 1911 in Endicott, New York, U.S.A.. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.

The companies that merged to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and most importantly for the development of the computer, punched card equipment. The product lines were very different, but Flint believed that since they all focused on equipment that made businesses more efficient, there were synergies and cross selling opportunities to be had.  Based in New York City, the new company had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.

Of the companies merged to form CTR, the most technologically significant was the Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punch cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input. officemuseum.com – early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment

The Tabulating Machine Company originally sold some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project with amazing speed, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. But creating markets for the new technology was a struggle, and by 1911 Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health, was looking to rest on his laurels. He sold the business to  Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then created C-T-R. Hollerith remained involved with C-T-R for some years as a consultant, but his involvement waned as time went on.

When the diversified businesses of C-T-R proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.. Watson became General Manager of C-T-R in 1914 and President in 1915. I Drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their",0,Wikipedia

Hi, thanks for message. You can sign your comments automatically using four tildes ~~~~. Please add your messages to the bottom of the talk page, or they may be overlooked. I deleted your article because 
it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. It is now Wikipedia policy that biographical articles about living people must have independent verifiable references, or they will be deleted. Although you gave some references, two were to his website, one was reporting what he said, and the third only confirmed that he had left a record label. In any case, it's not clear what makes Hip Hop World an independent third party source as linked above.
I can't actually see from your text how he meets the notability criteria linked above anyway
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. Examples of unsourced or self-sourced claims presented as fact include:  He fell in love with hip hop... also inspired... he became interested in the art of lyricism, deciding to further his passion... decided to follow his passion... Known for being able to sing and rapping in pidgin or Yoruba... interest for music became a greater calling he could not ignore... was able to explore his range of musical talent... did not however leave him lacking in his ability to contribute... but it was all good natured fun... working diligently... to give his fans the music they so rightfully deserve...— it's long on mind -reading, opinions and spam, and short of real facts, such as record sales, awards etc.
You have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that he is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could, if you wish, post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created.

"When I was 11, me and my family had just moved to a new house apartment. My family goes to work during the day occasionally leaving me alone with my brother (5 years old). We like to entertain ourselves in that free time by playing games, whatever we could come up with. So one day when we were playing, I casually looked down the window and I saw a man; and he kind of looked at me in this weird stare. I was only a kid, and so I kind of brushed him off and went back playing with my brother. A few hours later, I decided to peek out the window again just to look outside and the same man was still there looking at my window, but this time he had something in his hand tucked behind his back and he had this subtle smile which immediately sent a signal down my spine. I flinched away, trying to figure out what just happened, so I run into the other side of the house so I could secretly take a peek out the window again. I got to the other window but this time I did it stealthily hoping the man wouldn't see me. Thankfully he didn't, but then he started to climb through the gate and when he got to the door he tried to unlock it. I could clearly see that he had some kind of cleaver tucked behind his back and I start to freak out. I run to my brother and I tell him to go to his room and be very quiet because we're playing a game of who can stay silent the longest. Thankfully he fell for the game so once he got to his room I lock it quietly and at this point I could hear a loud rattle at the door. I begin to cry silently because I had a bad feeling and when I get scared like this I tend to faint/fall asleep because the fear is overwhelming. I run to the closet and I bury myself underneath a lot of things hoping I wouldn't get caught then I fell asleep. After some time had passed, I woke up-- thinking I must be in heaven or something, but the stench of dirty clothes reminded me that I'm still in the closet. My heart begins to pound out of my chest because I heard a loud banging on the door and I couldn't stop shaking. The banging on the door got louder and louder, and I begin to cry. I keep hearing the banging, so reflexively and foolishly I jumped out of the closet and screamed """"WHO IS IT?"""". My landlord and a couple of cops. They called my name out and escorted me outside to identify something. Once I got outside, I saw the same man from earlier but he was laying on the ground cuffed. He looked at me again but he had a sinister look and then he started laughing also in a sinister way (like in the exorcist).

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"""""no one"""""""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"""""no one"""""""". It is impossible to say """"""""no one are dinosaurs"""""""". It has to be """"""""no one is a dinosaur"""""""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"""""none"""""""" to """"""""no one"""""""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"""""none"""""""" is a synonym for """"""""nothing"""""""".

I could do a user subpage then test with something like {{User Johnuniq:convert|...}}, but that is klunky, and would be unsuitable in an article if I get bold enough to see how it goes in an article with some convert templates.

When diggers dug they have to organise the law and order themselves. Nearly every night robbers cut open tents and rob the diggers gold so, the diggers have to keep a pistol under their pillow. Diggers watched the people get punished and laugh at the robbers, one there's favourite punishments was putting on the robbers and then feathers on them. Diggers had to pay 30 shillings to dig gold. 
Keeping gold safe

Gold dust

Guard dogs

Transported gold to major cities

Diggers usually found gold dust so they have to warm it up, so they kept it in a warm matchbox to melt it together. They kept guard dogs so they don't have to hide there gold. They would hand their gold to commissioner to keep it safe if they didn't have a guard dogs. Some kept there gold in a special bag and they kept wax on its opening to seal it, to transport the gold to major city to keep it safe from bush rangers.

I'm surprised it's taken me this long to notice[edit source]

but this editor is obviously this indefblocked editor. Apart from similarity of interests, their edit summary is unmistakable. cheers, Struway2 (talk) 8:02 pm, Today (UTC+1)

Well very observant of you User:Struway - you're unbelievable! Okay so there are similar interests shared between myself and User Pablo is that a crime, does that automatically give you an incentive to ahead and immediately block my account no! Right so one user isn't allowed to share interests of another user ... you are way in over your head because what happens if there are some twins that register an account on here ... if they share similarities between each other (music), writing style etc. and one becomes a problem user but the other is the complete opposite you are then telling me that you will block the GOOD twin (from a Wikipedia point of view to spite the vandal twin) - now you have done that you have alienated this user from Wikipedia, and the better twin not only resents Wikipedia but they have also lost all faith in the encyclopedia and will NOT be recommending its services to his / her friends! Another scenario could be that a friend or relative has seen how the account user writes and has decided to hack into their account and perform some very inappropriate edits under that person's username ... meanwhile the owner of the account is completely oblivious to this and only when they log in or just take a look at their user talk page find that they have been either issued a warning (s) or have been BLOCKED for something they did NOT do as a result of the nastiness caused by the vandal (hacker), the person that has USED their account to create problems with other users and to ultimately get them in a lot of trouble with the Wikipedia Community.",0,Wikipedia

Next steps

I understand that you are keen to contribute to our article on fields. Now that your block for edit-warring has expired, you must decide how you want to progress this. I notice that while blocked you continued to edit the talk page with an IP. This is not permitted and I would be within policy and custom to reblock you for this, see WP:SOCK. I decline this time to do so, but I warn you not to repeat this or further measures will be taken against you. I hope this will not become necessary as you will not require to be blocked again. Do not edit war, see WP:EW, but discuss with your sources (see WP:IRS and WP:V) on the talk page, under your proper account. 

I know that editing here is a steep learning curve and I am willing to help you do it right. You must accept that we are a mature community with very well-established policies and customs. If you come here you have to work within that, just like if you get a job in a university you have to listen to the people who are already working there. I can tell you have a lot to offer to the project. Please make your arguments in talk, be patient and kind to the folks who wrote the article (I am not one but was asked to look at this by someone who is. This does not mean I endorse their opinion on how the article should read.) even (especially) when you disagree with their writing, and accept that you will seldom get all of what you want, just as in most areas of life. I am a volunteer just like you, but I have been around for a good while and I am entrusted with the janitorial role of making sure that things don't get damaged. In support of that role I am allowed to block users, protect articles from editing and certain other powers. I would very much rather not use them any further here. I am also a science graduate, and have some passing understanding of the subject you are here to edit, for whatever that may be worth.

Please resume your discussions in talk, but please do not edit-war or sock again. Let me know if you need any further help and I will be glad to offer it to you.   

My voice is important to me, if you take it upon yourself to snuff it out, or otherwise misrepresent it, in my book you are not out to help. 

The good cop bad cop, all-in-one schizo stuff is kinda weird; & your paternalism is waaaay off the mark. Ignoring you was not """"""""unwise"""""""", & I am hardly intimidated by your inadequate mastery of the rules you wish to nail to the wall. Perhaps you should review these dictates more closely yourself & check your double standards at the door. I am speaking of editing my criticisms of your actions amongst other things.

I did not start an """"""""edit war"""""""" as you imply. Your issue was personaldisobedience to be exact, with a sprinkling of that self empowering sparkle which lording over others endowsthe joy of duct tape & racquetball, which only a cop-at-heart can understand. I did not practice deception as you imply with the """"""""sock puppet"""""""", I signed my name to every puppets comment. I am not a perp, as implied by your actions in sum. Therefore you are barking up the wrong tree. I don't buy it that you are a robot bound to regs just doing your job as implied; you are a person making choices & you chose bad faith & laziness.

The generalisms you sincerely & patiently list, I'm sure are relevant in the wider context & larger community that you refer to & I'm sure what you do is of value there. I don't envy your job. In this case, however, we're talking two people debating in a forum, & an article that needs to be kept safe & sterile from any potential change lest something terrible happen! Is the cop/citizen ratio so mature in this community that there are resources to police such minor quibbles? Where am I Disneyland? Tracking IP's attached to names in order to reign in such terrorism is downright dumb for a supposedly progressive community. See WP WTF

If you place an obedient noob filter on any & every minor impulse-response test that passes though looking to improve upon the low grade blasphemy passing itself off for knowledge, you will reap what you sow. The page will never make it to the C grade it claims to be.

I do care about the subject, & *your* site is misrepresenting it for years now. I will continue to do what I can to fix it, with or without your rules if it's important to you that you stand in my way. There has been zero effort to address the fundamental criticism brought up a year ago now. How many people are going to bother explaining themselves after stroking a potentially infinite series of well meaning, but primarily self-serving policy enforcers hovering over a page, in order to change a few sentences?

 Pathetic Motorways, and the """"""""Walton Summit Motorway"""""""" 

I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a """"""""Wacky Website"""""""", but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!

UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of """"""""unsigned"""""""" motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.

The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the """"""""parent"""""""" motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.

As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short """"""""spur"""""""" motorway actually links two different motorways.

If it is part of the M65, as the """"""""start of restrictions"""""""" sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state """"""""M61 (M65)"""""""", meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.  

A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the """"""""start of restrictions"""""""" sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states """"""""A57(M)"""""""", but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the """"""""Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995"""""""" that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).

The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a """"""""C"""""""", """"""""D"""""""" or """"""""U"""""""" classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.""""",0,Wikipedia

Forgive me if I try to be brief. It's very early in the morning here, and I haven't slept yet. It's understandable that you didn't know of any active projects connected to WP:CVG when you made your proposal - It's not as if any of us are being paid to be here, are we? Now that I know why we weren't told, I don't have a problem with that part.

I'll read over the current proposal sometime today. I didn't respond to your comments at WP:MK because the previous discussion of the MK template split (which I was involved in) raised issues brought up in your proposal (that's how we were told). I believe that the main concern we had was over the ease of navigation, so the changes were reverted. I still have the same concerns about your proposal. Other WP:MK members may still share this opinion, have other issues, or are not bothered. That's why I've asked you to discuss your plans for the MK template with (the rest of) us before you proceed.

Personally, I agree with the aesthetic changes you're proposing, but I disagree with the severe limit on links in the template. The characters article you linked to was a good start, but it does no harm to link to some more categories that are related to the series, if only to make navigation more convenient. That's all that I'm prepared to say while I'm half-asleep, but if you have any more questions for me personally, I'll respond when I'm able to.  07:16",0,Wikipedia

 Havana City vs. Havana City Province 

The source of that confusion is that Havana City Province includes Havana and other cities like Marianao, Santiago de las Vegas, San Miguel del Padron, Regla, Guanabacoa and so on, with their own city halls, institutions, history, etc. Now, it is true that the history, the economy and the social lives of those cities have a strong bond with Havana. For example, Santiago de las Vegas grew because of the importance of the tobacco plantations, Havana had (and still has) tobacco factories. Havana was the most important port of the Spanish Empire in America, and the cities around also enriched because of that fact. Havana's growth swallowed all those cities around, and nowadays they seem to be one and only city, but this is only apparent. Even nowadays, when someone who lives in Marianao borough or district crosses the Almendares River, which is the border, he/she always says """"""""I'm going to Havana to shop"""""""". Anyway, you can merge both articles, or write one article for Havana and do the same for the rest of the disctrics. By the way, the population of Havana City Province of 2.2 million people, are from the last census of 2002. In ten years, the population have grown, for sure.

History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart
While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.

In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. 

(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.) 

Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.  

By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 """"""""colored"""""""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population. 

NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

Taking this hypothetical Shakespeare scenario, it would tell us about his writing process, and perhaps a little of the politics of theatre in his era. Was it delayed because of writer's block? Were elements of the play changed from the way he envisaged/first drew it out because of that? How did it change the theme, climax, or emotion of the show? Was it delayed because the people in power (ie. the theatre owners) disagreed with the play he had created (imagine their reaction if it centred around a homosexual relationship back in that day!)? Or was it perhaps the actors who disagreed with the roles they had to take on? Again that leads us into how Shakespeare worked around the writing problems so that the play could, eventually, go forwards. Or perhaps he had financial issues and that delayed aspects of production.

"""""I'm sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of 'Northumberland'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).

On the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can't deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.
As for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.

And as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn't proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish """"""""Viking"""""""" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don't care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly 'English'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.

Either way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.

Note: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn't about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it's folklore especially it's creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type.

Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General Assembly admitted as a member the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), under the name the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia';

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 (1993) states that the dispute over the name must be resolved to maintain peaceful relations between Greece and FYROM;

Whereas, on September 13, 1995, Greece and FYROM signed a United Nations-brokered Interim Accord that, among other things, commits them to not `support claims to any part of the territory of the other party or claims for a change of their existing frontiers';

Whereas a pre-eminent goal of the United Nations Interim Accord was to stop FYROM from utilizing, since its admittance to the United Nations in 1993, what the Accord calls `propaganda', including in school textbooks;

Whereas a television report in recent years showed students in a state-run school in FYROM still being taught that parts of Greece, including Greek Macedonia, are rightfully part of FYROM;

Whereas some textbooks, including the Military Academy textbook published in 2004 by the Military Academy `General Mihailo Apostolski' in the FYROM capital city, contain maps showing that a `Greater Macedonia' extends many miles south into Greece to Mount Olympus and miles east to Mount Pirin in Bulgaria;

Whereas, in direct contradiction of the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord's section `A', entitled `Friendly Relations and Confidence Building Measures', which attempts to eliminate challenges regarding `historic and cultural patrimony', the Government of FYROM recently renamed the capital city's international airport `Alexander the Great Airport';

Whereas the aforementioned acts constitute a breach of FYROM's international obligations deriving from the spirit of the United Nations Interim Accord, which provide that FYROM should abstain from any form of `propaganda' against Greece's historical or cultural heritage;

Whereas such acts are not compatible with Article 10 of the United Nations Interim Accord, which calls for `improving understanding and good neighbourly relations', as well as with European standards and values endorsed by European Union member-states; and

Whereas this information, like that exposed in the media report and elsewhere, being used contrary to the United Nations Interim Accord instills hostility and a rationale for irredentism in portions of the population of FYROM toward Greece and the history of Greece: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Senate

(1) urges the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to observe its obligations under Article 7 of the 1995 United Nations-brokered Interim Accord, which directs the parties to `promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by state-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility' and review the contents of textbooks, maps, and teaching aids to ensure that such tools are stating accurate information; and

(2) urges FYROM to work with Greece within the framework of the United Nations process to achieve longstanding United States and United Nations policy goals by reaching a mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.",0,Wikipedia

That wasn't an appeal, of course. But I'm dissappointed Cailil. This reply was the sort of lazy, hackneyed tripe I would expect from the average joe that that hangs out at ANI, or from the sort of petty pointless admin who runs around dolling out the stock phrases like this and blocking socks without even bothering to look at the edits they make, the sort of admin where you can be sure that for 90% of their daily activites, thinking about whether they're even benefitting Wikipedia or not doesn't even enter their thought process. You just thanked Black Kite for the """"""""heads up"""""""", which you would never have even got if it wasn't for me, the evil rule breaker. What's up with that? Can you deal with that Cailil? Can you deal with the idea that someone like me can in your eyes be 'breaking a rule' on Wikipedia (which, I might add, you still haven't even proven), while also apparently benefitting it by shining a light on the continuing bad behaviour of HighKing. You can't in all seriousness expect to come here and expect me to listen to this sort of crap, when you've discredited it with your own actions elsewhere. I saw Jimbo talking recently about how he vehemently disagreed with someone's claim that Wikipedia was very bad at dealing with whistleblowers. What say you? Or is it all just rhetoric to you? You could unblock me yourself if you really wanted, nobody forced you to make this block. Not even Black Kite thought it was necessary, which is saying something, as he hands out blocks like confetti. I don't have any issue with promising you that the next time I want to make a complaint about HighKing, I'll use this account, if it satisfies your need to be able to track my history, if it satisfied your need to enfore a rule, even though doing so is entirely pointless in this case. But it's almost like you want people like me to sock, it's almost like you want me to break the rules, it's almost like you think it helps to have HighKing running around blaming all his woes on socks, when you know it's just one of many ways he tries to deflect attention from his own edits. What is the official story now, btw? He seems to have caught on to the fact that there is more than one person who is critical of him, yet you seem to be taking the retrograde step of going back to his old theory that we're all the same person. Can you really not see how your approach only exacerbates the issue? That it only makes eventual resolution less likely, or at least add another couple of years onto the final reckoning of just how well Wikipedia was able to deal with the sort of behaviour HighKing is by now the textbook example of. Or have you just been working around Sandstein for far too long, and you've completely lost your higher brain functions and can now only operate literally to the rule book as he does, the freak that he is. Maybe if you were truly honest about the fact that who we are doesn't make a blind bit of difference to whether or not you are doing what you should be with regard to HighKing, you wouldn't find yourself having to make these sort of replies, which must surely make you feel just that little bit shameful. You cannot really be happy that you feel have to say things like this to people like me, things that are so obviously intelectually dishonest that if it wasn't already the case, you just know we're not going to take a blind bit of notice of them? Because like it or lump it, whether you treat me as the enemy or as a whistle blower, I'm not going away, not until the HighKing situation is resolved one way or the other. And neither is anyone else by the looks of it. I don't even care if the resolution is that he becomes a good editor. That's how foolish it is for you to continue on this track. I'm not harassing HighKing in any way, shape or form, and you have still yet to establish whether I am an illegitimate sock or not. This is why you avoid the central issues like that when answering for blocks like this, instead preferring the sort of non-reply reply given above. It's just poor, Cailil, very poor.

"Janbwade: The statements you question are all verified in the body of the article from secondary and primary sources. The primary source is the Watchtower organization itself. If anything, this source is biased towards itself, which is understandable. The other sources are diverse and unbiased, and peer reviewed. Since these secondary sources are reviews of data then bias is not only unlikely, but virtually impossible. So, if anything, we can say none of the sources are hostile toward the Watchtower organization or to the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Hence I fail to see veracity in your complaint. 

I recommend that you consider the sub-heading “Acceptance within Jehovah’s Witness community” within the article about Jehovah’s Witnesses and blood transfusion. If you dispute its content and sources then please specify exactly why. Also, please keep in mind that due to 1) the Watchtower organization’s policy to have JWs shun JWs who conscientiously accept transfusion of blood products it forbids, and 2) your reputation as an ardent supporter of Watchtower policies, then it is expected that JWs who disagree with the Watchtower’s blood doctrine would not you access to their choices, and HIPPA regulations are a powerful incentive for clinicians to keep patient preference highly confidential, particularly when it is specifically requested.

The regard of Israeli Arabs as an indiginous minority is a theory or a claim. It is not a fact. It is very hard to determine which of the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine is an immigrant from other parts of the Middle East, or a descendant of such an immigrant, and which of them is actually indigenous. This way or another, the conflict between Israel and its Arab citizens cannot be said to be the mere result of a universal phenomenon of tension between indigenous people and newly established authorities.

The article's title is misleading. It leads us to believe it will be an article on historical (historicity) of Jesus. In fact, it is an article on Historical Portraits of Jesus, and should be named as such. 

Secondly, the subtitles need to be renamed/reorganized, and some material needs to be shifted into different categories. The entire """"""""cultural background"""""""" subsection is Christian POV and should be named as such. Historical elements needs to be largely removed, since this article is about portraits, and some of the further subsections of that category are already covered in the Historicity of Jesus article, and are in fact duplicated there.

Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish """"""""Cross""""""""'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is """"""""Jewish"""""""". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not """"""""ethnically"""""""" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is """"""""Black"""""""" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is """"""""Jewish"""""""" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had """"""""Jewish mother"""""""". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her """"""""Jewish"""""""", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't """"""""ethnically"""""""" all Jewish if that was relevant.

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"""""genocide"""""""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """"",0,Wikipedia

Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited.

Thank you. My problem was with labeling Achilles a """"""""sexual predator."""""""" Presumably Sommerstein will go on to identifying Daedaluas as the first aviator and Andromache as the first feminist. Without in any way denying the existence of sexual predation then and now, this particular use of the phrase strikes me as homophobic. It raises the question, which other (nonmurderous) sexual predators he is thinking of? Solon? Socrates? Aeschines? I can only view it as a homophobic remark directed at the Greeks in general. If so, that raises questions about the propriety of repeating it here.

To add to that, what information do we have on the respective ages of the two? Am I mistaken or was Troilus described as a boupais? It has been a while since I studied the topic, but I seem to recall he was nineteen when he died, one year short of the magic twenty needed to save Troy. Achilles, on the other hand, was sixteen when he shed his female garb and left with Oedipus to join the battle, I believe. And the killing is said to have happened early in the war. So what can Sommerstein be editorializing about? An adolescent preying upon an adult?

On a separate note, I never saw anything claiming that Achilles fell in love with Polyxena at the same time as with Troilus. Everything points to his lying in wait at the Lion fountain expressly to get the boy, not the girl (though it may be significant that she was sacrificed by the Greeks at his tomb).

One more thing - when the brothers (which ones?) of Troilus ride - too late - to his rescue, Achilles meets them in Apollo's temple with an unusual weapon: Troilus' head, which he is swinging around by the hair. It is such a gory detail, it would be a pity to not include it, I just no longer have the sources.  """"",0,Wikipedia

(Candidate page, with my comments) I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article, missing commas, etc. I went through the first half, but haven't had time to fix the second half. At any rate, you probably just didn't see my objection; I'll do more to address it myself, but the style isn't up to par for our (rightly) high standards for featured articles.  talk

Please provide a reference with verifable resources to prove your claim that

I have provided a New York times  link proving that in Russia and major cities of Central Asia it is NO longer a test but a blood sport.

For arguement sake lets say a test is done today .
Please discuss with me how a test can be done if the dogs that FAIL are not removed from breeding?

Why does this """"""""test"""""""" involve gambling? 

Please also tell me how dogs temperament and or working qualities are NOT inherited from the mothers side? Since only males are fougth.

In addition why does one have to test a dog to a dog if the dogs themselves are not working with livestock or will ever see a predator?

Please do not repeat here the information you can not prove but is your opinion on the main page.. 

Im quite sure ENGLISH links are available some where to prove this is a real working test vs the blood sport it has become.

I know that the Croatian perspective is somewhat different. This comes from a very specific historiographical school, which had among its roots Grga Novak. Assuming that Dalmatia was one of the most primitive of Europe at the time of Venetian domination, we must also think that since 1797 to the date you specified (1945) they are 150 years. Josip Smodlaka stated in 1911 (1911!) that Dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of Europe. As you can understand, we can not talk only of the Italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact. I think it is enough the logic to start to demand other questions, which the historiography of your country has not yet met.151.48.28.216

Nature Magazine: ‘An excellent compendinum…enlivened by many pungent asides’

Arthur C. Clarke (who also wrote the Foreword): ‘I regard James Randi as a national treasure, and one of the few remaining antidotes that may prevent the rotting of the American mind.’

Martin Gardiner (editor of  Scientific American  ):  ‘A much needed contribution to the nation’s sanity … Randi has written a hard-hitting, no holds barred encyclopedia of the major cranks, charlatans, and follies of our time.’

Randi’s tone may be dry and a little mocking, and Rawat’s followers might not quite agree with all of his observations, but that is not the issue here.  The source is legit, in Wiki terms.

Hitler was quite right when he said that Admiral Graf Spee should have won the battle. She lost because of errors made by captain Langsdorff. Graf Spee outgunned all her opponents, having 11 inch main guns, to Exeters 8 inch and Ajax and Achilles 6 inch guns.

Langsdorff should have concentrated the fire on Exeter first before Admiral Graf Spee came into the range of the light cruisers.

Instead, Langsdorff split his fire between the three targets, with the result that although Exeter was severely damaged and forced to withdraw, the other ships got into range and scored 20 hits on Admiral Graf Spee, including on the food stores and bakeries.""""",0,Wikipedia

""""""""The opening movement  is performed by all forces with the exception of the recorders """""""" (emhasis added) contains an interpretation which can not be sourced to a (primary source) score. Unless the editor of that score inserted a text note to that effect (or Bach wrote such note in his manuscript which I don't think is the case here). In that case the name of the editor needs to be given (the editor is the source, not the music Bach wrote down and which was transferred to a printed score), preferably also date of publication, etc.
I'd recommend to change all """"""""score"""""""" references to a publicly available score (if possible). Then the interpretations that aren't directly clear from the music notes and accidentals on the page, get different references with named authors.

Anyhow, what is interpretation and what is non-interpretative deduction I can't check, while the references are made to a publication I currently have no access to.

More important is to understand what WP:PRIMARY is about, when writing an article. The answer above didn't put me at ease... so yes the dozens of references to the (Bärenreiter) """"""""score"""""""" source need to be checked. I don't feel like putting the  template on top of the page while probably most of these are in order, but that's in fact what I should do until it is all checked.

 New archive 
This page has been quiet for a few weeks, so I created a new archive at Talk:Monty Hall problem/Archive 9 for the discussions from mid Oct 2008 through Feb 2009 (indicated as """"""""archived"""""""" above).  Several of the issues aren't exactly resolved (they will perhaps never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction), but the period of relative calm seemed like an opportune time to create a new archive.  I added a new section (post archiving) much like this one.  user:Glkanter has reverted these changes, suggesting we talk about it first.  OK.  Since we're at a lull in the discussion here, and the talk page is huge, I suggest now is an appropriate time to archive.   Rick Block (talk) 

 Agree with archiving now. The talk page is monster-sized, and nobody is going to read through it all anyway. –  

I don't agree there has been a 'lull'. It's just been re-directed to the arguments page. I assume most readers (not necessarily editors) do NOT read archives. If they're interested, maybe they get as far as a talk page. Anyway, I think that the existence and vehement nature of the MHP article disagreement would not be evident if the entire thing were archived. A reader might think that there was universal satisfaction with the construction of the article. That would be an inaccurate impression to give.   

This thread will remain here, and it already says there are unresolved issues.  If you'd like to enumerate them here that will remain here as well.  Good enough?  Rick Block (talk) 

I didn't know there was an """"""""arguments"""""""" page, so I too thought it had settled down.  It would be very useful to have a concise list here of what the ongoing issues about the article are, phrased as neutrally as possible, with links to where some discussion about them may be found.

I do not see how it is relevant if sources use the word famous.  We are never obliged to use the same words as any source.  You can find a source claiming that almost anything is famous - it's hardly a rare case where lots of sources do so - so should we describe everything as famous?  No, I tried that and it was rightly shot down.  You can find a source - a famous one! - which says that this opera is a shabby little shocker.  And those words aren't even listed as ones to avoid, so do we use them as if they are objectively true?  Obviously not.
I don't believe the word is forbidden on Wikipedia, I already said that.  But we have a guideline called """"""""words to avoid"""""""".  It doesn't say """"""""avoid these words, unless you really want to use them"""""""", it doesn't say """"""""avoid these words unless you see them in external sources"""""""", it says """"""""avoid these words, because they neither impart nor summarise verifiable information"""""""".

 Modern mainstream economics 

The modern mainstream economics section repeats itself a lot.

It opens with """"""""Mainstream economics begins with the premise that resources are scarce and that it is necessary to choose between competing alternatives.""""""""  this is a reiteration of something found in the opening of the article - """"""""the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.""""""""  Someone must really like repeating that though because later on in this section we see 

""""""""Economics studies how individuals and societies seek to satisfy needs and wants through incentives, choices, and allocation of scarce resources.""""""""

Then later in this section we see

""""""""neoclassical economics, which began to develop in the late 1800s and models choices made in the allocation of scarce resources.""""""""

Then later in this section

""""""""It is sometimes referred to as the study of choice under conditions of scarcity.""""""""

Then later in this section

""""""""Economics is a broad term given to the social science of how choices are made in face of limited resources.""""""""

Then later in this section a word for word repetition of what was said in the opening -

""""""""the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses""""""""

Reading all of this I conclude that mainstream economics studies the relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.

 List of USN ships 

Hello, I've been doing some updating and correcting on the article List of current ships of the United States Navy. I see that you contributed a great deal to article previously. At one point, with about a half dozen edits, you added 24 ships to the section """"""""Ready Reserve Force ships"""""""". You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships. I'm wondering if you had other info that stated these other 19 ships were considered a part of that class?

Translation of AIDS quote
The original quote about AIDS is « Les sidaïques, en respirant du virus par tous les pores, mettent en cause l'équilibre de la nation. (…) Le sidaïque, – si vous voulez, j'emploie ce mot-là, c'est un néologisme, il est pas très beau mais je n'en connais pas d'autre –, celui-là, il faut bien le dire, est contagieux par sa transpiration, ses larmes, sa salive, son contact. C'est une espèce de lépreux, si vous voulez ». As a bilingual speaker, my translation would be more like:

""""""""The aids-ers, by breathing virus from every pore, put in question the balance of the nation(...). The aids-er - if you like, I use that word, it's a neologism (coining/solecism), it's not very pretty but I don't know any other-, that [person], it must be said, is contagious through his sweat, his tears, his saliva, his touch. He's somewhat like a leper, if you like.""""""""

He does not claim that it's a type of leprosy - 'c'est une espèce de lépreux' does literally mean '(he/she/it) is a type of leper' but is in fact a colloquial way of making an imprecise comparative. So, to summarise: he makes inaccurate statements about the means of transmission of HIV, and he compares people living with HIV to lepers/leper colonies as part of his advocacy for their forced internment.""""",0,Wikipedia

 WP:AFC on Marathonios 

Note: The following post by an IP about Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus Marathonios has been copied here from User talk:EdJohnston/Anontalk.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my proposed article! As the source of the wealth of Herodes Atticus probably was his grandfather, i thought some sentences could exist for him, having also an interesting story. His name is (or almost is) as set in my article, through many sources (of which a mentioned in the article only one):
http://www.geni.com/people/Tiberius-Claudius-Hipparchus-de-Marathon/6000000013238402549
http://www.muldermedia.com/roots/INDIs/II2429.html
http://www.genealogieonline.nl/kwartierstaat-vermaat/I8432.php
http://books.google.gr/books?id=l-QEF9UMAvAC&pg;=PA278&dq;=%22tiberius+Claudius+Hipparchus%22&hl;=el&sa;=X&ei;=6kXkT67rJsrCswbIo9CDCQ&ved;=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q;=%22tiberius%20Claudius%20Hipparchus%22&f;=false

Marathonios shows descent from Marathon, a famous town of Attica. It was usual at the time to always add the town to which one was belonging. So, most of the times one was using only his first name, but among faraway people the town was used as well (Thales of Miletus or Miletios etc). Whether Wikipedia's policy is to use the full name or just the first i cannot tell and i would appreciate your advice.
But.. in this article http://mapyourinfo.com/wiki/en.wikipedia.org/Herodes%20Atticus/ (see Ancestry) Wikipedia already uses that exact name!  
Probably the right spelling might have been Marathonius, as all the name in in latin, but mostly is mentioned as Marathonios, so i would vote this way.
— Preceding unsigned comment added by 79.129.49.66   

Thanks for your note. If you create future AFC nominations, the record-keeping is easier if you will create an account, instead of using a variety of IP addresses. My original AFC comment was based on the linked sources not supporting your submission. It appeared to me that bits of information about different ancient figures were being mixed up together. This runs of the risk of an article misinforming our readers. In your above post, geni.com etc are not considered to be WP:Reliable sources for Wikipedia. The Google Book is OK but it only confirms that Herod Atticus's grandfather was known as Tiberius Claudius Hipparchus, without the word 'Marathonios'. So your information has no reliable source. Herod Atticus may have had a relative known as 'Marathonios', but that seems to be a different person who was born after the death of Hipparchus.    """"",0,Wikipedia

"I have a few thoughts below, but basically it amounts to cost vs. benefit. * The freight system is more complicated than, say, automated trams at an airport. While the basic principle is still the same, the hurdles are much bigger. Way more switching, trains are harder to drive, lots of manual switching and linking, predictive nature of driving enormously big and heavy things. I'm not saying these can't be overcome; it's just that the costs to do so are crazy high. * There are huge --HUGE-- sections of our nation's railway that have no signals or systems (""""dark territory"""") that make automation especially tricky right now. Many chunks of dark territory have switches that are completely manual; you must have an engineer get off of the train and turn a massive crank to switch track. Also, there's no way right now for trains in dark territory to know where other trains are. It's all done with radio communication. The list goes on from there. Essentially you need major track updates for huge sections of the nation's railway in addition to ways to feed information into the train system. That's a big old chunk of change. * In many cases you'd have to turn large numbers of freight locomotives from mainly mechanical operations to fly-by-wire systems. Locos are very expensive. * Imagine the union battles. * Transitioning from a group of mostly humans driving trains to all automated drivers is very tricky. When you have 100% humans, the decision making is pretty clear, and when you have all automated systems, decision making is also clear. But what happens when you have humans AND automated trains on the same lines? Confusion, probably. It takes a lot of resources to figure out how to make that work. * I wonder what the perceived cost would be if an """"automatic"""" train killed a pedestrian. Considering suicides and train yards alone, it's unavoidable. I would imagine the storm of crap generated by the media would be enormous. So basically, you could figure this out and still have a pretty big additional cost of upkeep for everything, or you could just keep humans in the loop.",0,Reddit

My girlfriend has an insane aversion to garlic so I rarely get to indulge in Middle-Eastern cuisine.  I've considered leaving her over this matter, but who would pay her half of the rent? It's a tough decision, garlic versus rent, one that I take very seriously.  FA was really just a very conventional teen romance movie, but with lesbians instead of heterosexuals.  Think The Breakfast Club, but with two characters, both with breasts.  Secretary was instrumental in helping me realize that James Spader wasn't a douche, though I wouldn't go out of my way to see any of his movies past or present.   
Indeed.  I used to live very close to the ByTowne Cinema in Ottawa, which contributed towards my excellent taste.  Now I live much further away and sadly the last movie I watched was Blades of Glory.  I was drunk at the time.  Now I'm sober, and filled with shame.

"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166

 Demand for too many sources 

Some people have demanded way more sources than are necessary for this article. For example, the request for a secondary source for the fact that The Inquirer has criticized the publication of EG's real name. This is utter rubbish. From WP:NOR:

An article or section of an article that relies on a primary source should (1) only make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge, and (2) make no analytic, synthetic, interpretive, explanatory, or evaluative claims.

The section in question states: """"""""The Inquirer has criticized this deletion[8] as well as the revelation of the model's real name during the deletion discussions by Wikipedia users (the model's name and identity had been kept confidential by The Inquirer).[9]""""""""

We comply with (1): the claim is only descriptive (it reproduces what the Inq stated in their article) and is EASILY verifiable. The information is also not interpreted, thus we also comply with (2). As such, I'm removing the redundant second source.

Further, I recently added a citation for Mike Magee's quote from BusinessWeek. Again, I am removing this. The quote appears in the earlier reference to the same BusinessWeek article, and citations are allowed to span multiple sentences. """"",0,Wikipedia

Thanks for your comments. They were very encouraging. We're hoping to go again at FAC in the next few days. 

The way I got involved with this article was that I opposed it at its last FAC about a month ago, felt guilty, and realised that I could probably meet my own objections, if I rolled my sleeves up. The links are just about last on the list of things to do: one goes down tunnels in this article and loses a sense of the overall warren. They are pains in the arse, though, especially things like Henry IV, I, 2, 3, plus the fact that Shakespeare unhelpfully named his plays after a bunch of Wikipedia articles.

I'm a history man, really, which is probably why the tragedy stuff comes over cacklike. It's hellish, though, trying to sum up 38 plays in four paragraphs, and I've probably relied too much on my Bradley. Fortinbras does march on after the Hamlet bloodbath to herald the new order, though. Anyway, I will try a rewrite at that point, """"""""lest more mischance on plots and errors happen"""""""".

RfC: The Correct Name Of The Video Game (Independent Of The Article's Title)

Foreword: as the section's title indicates, this matter is completely irrelevant to the title of this Wikipedia article.

The concern right now involves the correct title of this video game. One position is C: The Contra Adventure, the other is simply The Contra Adventure. The latter is supported only by the assumption that the large """"""""C"""""""" in the game's packaging case and manual is nothing more than a """"""""logogram"""""""" and not part of the actual name.

There is weighted evidence that supports the notion that the official name of this video game is C: The Contra Adventure. Here is a sample of reputable sources, out of a pool of several:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure

http://klustr.net/contra/games/
https://contrapedia.wordpress.com/c-the-contra-adventure/

Further, the other games in the Contra series have a similar design to the name on their packaging:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_III:_The_Alien_Wars
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Hard_Corps
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Legacy_of_War
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra:_Shattered_Soldier
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Corps:_Uprising

They are universally and unanimously accepted as having the colon and the text that precedes it in the official title.

The strongest evidence that supports the title of C: The Contra Adventure is present directly in the video game's instruction manual, on several pages:

I think that you should reformat User:Shanes/Why tags are evil#The vandalism protection tags (or at least the idea) into some sort of proposal to reformat multiple distracting protection tags to less distracting corner icons; for example, redirecting  to  (well, probably move the later to the former, for this case). The corner icons work beautifully, are much less distracting, and clicking them will follow you to a page explaining what the lock is for.

I fully agree that the large box with text is very distracting and unnecessary.

They probably don't care that they can't edit the article, nor would they, and of most concern—they may confuse the tag with the article content.

I wanted to protest in no uncertain terms that you have been extremely unfair in blocking only me. Abhishek is equally guilty if not more guilty than me yet he gets away with a pep talk & i get blocked. besides that i have always maintained that he is entitled to his opinion but facts are different like the image on august kranti & surat station. do i really need to have the time to go into so much detail about everything? can he explain why he undid the image on surat station despite me having written that it is an incorrect image other than for ego reasons?

he is just undoing my work because of ego problems. if you go through his history, he has even refused to accept a government of india notification & his history is full of edits of other people's work. now you may say that i am wrong. 1 person can be wrong but how can so many people be wrong & except him how many have actually removed anything that i have uploaded? He is more than welcome to add any relevant image on things where he considers my work irrelevant, i have yet to see anything on that front.

1 more thing. Every image that i have added has been taken my me which means that i have actually gone to the various places.

I have done my best to reason it out with him, to discuss something else on which we can agree- i have had no success there either.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Indiana.jpeg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Indiana.jpeg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 7 days after this notification, per our Fair Use policy.

Re: question posed to Shell about my comments above

Re: a question posed to Shell over on her talk page: I did not say that Shell advised me to delete comments made about the block or the Sept. 5, 2008 AN/I from my current talk page; I said that """"""""upon the advice of Shell"""""""", which she made to me, not to continue the discussion of the AN/I on my current talk page, that neither should anyone else be doing that on my current talk page. I explained (in this section) that I would be at first editing out (using < !  /  >) and then deleting any comments made subsequent to the blocking of me by gnangarra/garra. (They are still visible in preview mode so that people who posted them can copy and post them as comments to Shell, e.g., or in a pertinent not closed AN/I, which they are free to re-open if they wish.)
See """"""""NYScholar issues revisited"""""""" (archived discussion): instructions are in the top of the archive box; w/ the closing administrator's Gnangarra/garra's Conclusion/Summary.  The directions say that if one wants to engage in """"""""subsequent"""""""" discussion of it, one needs to start a new page at WP:AN/I.  My current talk page is not for that kind of discussion.
(cont.) My point: If I can't discuss the AN/I on my talk page, neither can others continue to do so on my talk page. I do not welcome further comments about it (since I am restricted from replying to them by Shell and the current blocking administrator's block), and, therefore, I will delete them.  To continue to place them here, on my talk page, is, in my view, based on what Shell has advised me about my own comments, inappropriate.
(cont.) Re: views about the current block by Gnangarra/garra:  people can contact the blocking administrator Gnangarra/garra directly to comment on the block one way or the other.  But one does need to keep in mind that it is a violation of WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:Etiquette to lobby for blocks of other users who are not engaging in any currently blockable behavior (as I am not).
(cont.) See WP:BLOCK for policy; blocks are not supposed to be punitive; they are supposed to be preventative.  I and Shell have questioned the validity of the current block. Scroll up to unblock request(s).
(cont.) If unsure, people do need to consult the links provided in my #N.B. section above, which will go to policies and guidelines relating to commenting on user talk pages.
(cont.) At Shell's request in the AN/I (at end of archived version), she asks people to contact her directly if they have specific concerns about my editing in Wikipedia done after the closing of the AN/I, as she is currently my mentor and is trying to guide me to have better communications with other Wikipedians in talk pages particularly.  Please see the end of the now-archived closed report via WP:ANI.  Thanks again.    
My current talk page is also not for debating Gnangarra/garra's (in my view and that of Shell) unfounded block of me (my unblock request explains my view of it); if you have your own views about the block, please communicate them on Gnangarra/garra's talk page or on the talk page of the last declining administrator , not on my talk page, but please be mindful of WP:CIVIL and Wikipedia:Etiquette, or you yourselves may find yourselves blocked (!).  Lobbying for (or perhaps even against) blocks of me on my talk page (or elsewhere) is, in my view, uncivil and a violation of Wikipedia:Etiquette, and I will delete further such discussions from my current talk page.  I am not currently editing Wikipedia because I am blocked from doing so.  I don't want also to become blocked from my own talk page.  If people make personal comments about me as a contributor, I will consider them potential violations of WP:CIVIL, and I will remove them, as per the policies already linked in my """"""""N.B."""""""" section; please read it.

 Communism, The CRC, Robeson and the Civil rights movement 

As this is a survey and there was zero mention of the CPUSA and the many battles they fought in the pre-1955 era, I feel that history warrants the inclusion. To call the CRC a """"""""fringe"""""""" group is to show a paucity of history of what led up to 1955. Civil Rights historians have been scared and embarrassed or ignorant regarding the huge amount of work that Communists, The CRC, Robeson did vis a vis groups such as the CRC. This history is documented and it is CIVIL RIGHTS HISTORY even if Eyes on The Prize left it out. Also not all the members were Communist many were the same folks who went on marches and who were suffering injustices in small KKK towns in the South. Also the distancing from CP was key at the time. I'm ready to add sources but would like to hear from Malik etc. Thanks  """"",0,Wikipedia
"Opinion sought 

Hi sleepless. I am contacting you, somewhat at random, as I noticed you have closed several AFD recently and as you are generally regarded as a good admin. The page User:GabrielF/911TMCruft has been serving as a de facto noticeboard for people proposing and following AFD's on a particular topic: 9/11.  To an extent has begun to broaden its focus into politically related articles in general, serving as an AFD conservative noticeboard. Among several recent examples, the Yellowcake forgery nomination was listed there as it went on AFD. This sort of private noticeboard strikes me as quite counter to the ideal collaborative and neutral spirit of AFD. I doubt, for example, that we would permit a WP:AFD noticeboard on topic X. Isn't that what AFD itself is for? So, I personally take issue with a user-space page which is serving the same role of co-ordinating editors with a particular outlook.  There seems to be quite a lot of pre-discussion among editors watching that page, almost all of it off the relevant article talk pages. An unwiki lack of transparency, in my opinion. 

Enough intro. What I'd like your opinion about is whether such a userpage is suitable to put through AFD itself. I've never seen such (userpage, not article), but I'm not sure how else to go about getting it deleted. Can it be speedied? Or am I just nuts, and this sort of thing is ok? 

Disclaimer, I got in a dispute related to the use of this page yesterday. My dislike for the noticeboard led to the dispute, not the reverse.

"Do you share bank accounts or credit cards with her? You can see how this can cause many relationships to go sour. Letting your girlfriend live with you for free is similar. For some people, two years is a very serious relationship. For others, it is nothing. From my point of view, girlfriend is not a fiancée or a wife. Serious problems can develop when people share money/wealth. In your situation, you are sharing your biggest financial asset and your future earnings (a loan/mortgage is a contract to give up your future earnings) with your girlfriend for free. I believe that people are generally good, but if you set up a system where you can be taken advantage of, you can create bad behavior. In this case, your girlfriend has a strong incentive to view you as a money source (free place to live) as well as a boyfriend. That can plant the seeds for trouble in the future. Example: She is less likely to voice her concerns and more likely to put up with bad behavior from you because she is dependent on you for housing. This might sound great in the short term, but it is not healthy for a long term relationship because you would become more and more of a provider than a lover. And by posting on this board, there is clearly something on your mind saying that it isn't fair that you pay for her housing. That can only grow over time. My suggestion is to charge her cheap rent. It would be fair to charge her a rent that is cheaper than getting a single room, since she is effectively """"roommates"""" with you (i.e. how much would it cost for her to roommate with someone else?).

 History of Liverpool F.C. 

Hi, I have reverted your latest edit because it appears to be a verbatim quotation from someone else's work, and therefore, if not a breach of copyright, plagiarism. We cannot do this, for legal reasons. May I invite you to rewrite it in your own words, adding a citation to your source? That would fix the problem. Thanks. andemu 
Editors have moved further information to the History article to make sure that we present a coherent and concise description of LFC as a whole. We should have only the most relevant and important info in the main article. E.g. That the City of Liverpool has made a World Cup bid is verging on off topic, especially when LFC's involvement is only with the use of its stadium. The rail station info has nothing to do with LFC in the slightest.
Liverpool's split from Everton was already mentioned, and described in detail in the article about Liverpool FC's history. What facts exactly am I supposed to be """"""""getting over""""""""?   
Also, I do not like being described as a vandal. Especially when that's clearly not how I've been acting. It's quite insulting. Please read here for a description of what a """"""""vandal"""""""" is.   
Agreed. Removal of unsourced information, particularly if it may be a breach of WP:COPYRIGHT is not vandalism and saying that it is breaches our policy on personal attacks. Please don't add it back without citing its source, and certainly not without rewriting in your own words in a narrative style, because I'm afraid if you do, you will be blocked from editing here. Furthermore, references to Hitler are equally likely to get you blocked. Please take some time getting used to our policies before going much further. Thanks. andemu 
Abstract
OK, well we now have a citation- thanks- but merely quoting from an abstract isn't quite there yet. What we need to say is something like """"""""In a study by Leeds University researchers X and Y, it was stated that .. """""""", although if different researchers have come to different conclusions or present different facts, this should also be mentioned (with sourcing) for balance. andemu 
Believe it or not, we are trying to help you here, but I've had to remove this university study again- the citation you gave just did not support the content you added, and therefore, your edit failed verifiability policy. You need to take points from a full, published, version, not just an abstract. Even if it is your own work, it is original research and not permitted here. Any further disruption may lead to a block, but at least that would give you some time to read other articles to see how they are written, and sourced. andemu 

OK, I've rewritten it to cite the research. There is no need for there to be a section on the research; the article is about the club, not the research. Hopefully that shuold get us somewhere. UK

Hi Diza, re: your edit on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis I just wanted to let you know that this is a discussion that's been had before.

Although about 5% or so survive past 10 years most do not.

"This is so true. I went to a high school out of my district because it was the closest one that offered the French Immersion program that I was in. This school happened to have a majority of kids who were mostly higher on the socioeconomic scale and didn't know what it was like to stress about money as an individual or as a family. However, growing up that way has shaped me in what I believe to be a positive way. It's made me appreciate what I do have, to place more value on relationships, people and the time spent with them versus accumulating things. So whether we're taking a vacation or hanging out at someone's house, it's the time I value, not any money I might have spent to be there. Plus, as a carry over from my upbringing, I'm really frugal and tend to be the kind of person who's content as long as the bills are paid and I'd prefer to put most of what's leftover directly into savings so I'm never in a """"no money"""" position again (and at times I take that to an extreme - I'm still learning). Interestingly enough, my husband grew up in a family that was upper middle class and could pretty much afford to do whatever he wanted. I've definitely noticed a pretty big difference in how we feel about spending money, and his approach towards money in general due to his upbringing. He actually got himself into a bit of a bind financially after he moved out on his own and bought a house even despite the fact that he had a great starting salary at his job out of college. He just kept spending the way he had and the way he'd watched his parents do his entire life and didn't adjust for the fact that his income, while great for his age, wasn't anywhere near what he grew up with. He's still learning to spend less and place less value on material items, while I'm still learning that we don't need to hoard every penny in our savings accounts and can afford to treat ourselves occasionally.

So don't see a point in inserting your """"""""The New Paper"""""""" article of her refuting the claims.
4. Removed the youtube link as I was told there's copyrights involved.
5. Also related to 4., you seem to want to to include comments made by PM Lee about TPL. I don't see the point. So may I know each time a minister talks about TPL, are you going to write it in?
6. I've made those edits to shorten the article. It was too lengthy, too many quotes.
7. I don't see the point of including her treasurer post in 16th council when I've updated her role in 17th.

"""""

 The following is based on personal speculation so, once again, feel free to correct me if I get this wrong.

 While there are some surface similarities between racial hygiene and ethnic cleansing, I believe that the concept of racial hygiene did not play a major role in the expulsions documented in this article.

 The major unique feature of racial hygiene is the concept of race and genetics (eugenics).  This concept argues that you are who you are by dint of your parents race and genetics and that what you think and how you act is irrelevant to the """"""""pollution"""""""" caused by your inferior genes.  Thus, Hitler could argue for an Aryan super-race that was polluted by Jewish, Slavic and other inferior races.  If you had any forebears from a non-Aryan race, you were suspect.

 In contrast, ethnic cleansing is more about removing those of a different ethnicity where ethnicity is usually marked by language, religion and customs.  Those considered to be a different ethnicity might be of the same race (e.g. Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda).  It is hard to argue that Poles and Germans are of different races unless you are a Nazi.  To most people, they are just different ethnicities of the Caucasian race.  It is similarly hard to argue that the various ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats, Bosnians) in the the former Yugoslavia are of different races.  As far as I know, the major differences are language and religion.

 As a thought experiment, consider the case of a German woman married to a Polish man in the first half of the 20th century.  If the family spoke Polish at home and raised their children as Poles (i.e. Polish-speaking Catholics), would that family have been expelled?  I doubt it.  If you agree, then you can see that the expulsions of ethnic Germans may have been motivated by ethnic cleansing but not by racial hygiene.

 Hope that helps.

Against merge
The Uvs Nuur has already been confused by making the article about the lake instead of the basin. Much of the relevant information has been removed or confused in the merge or copy/paste or whatever an editor did. The hollow, although lumped in with the World Heritage site is really about a different set of issues including nomadic peoples, archeology sites, enormous variation in terrain, endangered animals etc. The current article on Uvs Nuur seems to have missed all the relevant points on the geological aspects, plus the name of the article is different from the name given on World Heritage Site. Further, the editors have disregarded that almost all citations are about the basin; there is hardly anything in the article about the lake. 

If you refuse to allow editors to write articles that they are interested in, and insist on an instant mindless merge, we can have an RFC, which I will abide by, unless you consent to a rewrite of the current article so it is accurate and not confusing. Why do you have such an investment in preventing other editors from writing articles about what they are interested in. It is against policy to #REDIRECT without a discussion which is what was done before. Please consider this, rather than instinctively merge everything.

The rise and development of the Haskalah, or Jewish enlightenment, was different in Western Europe and Eastern Europe.

The motivation behind this was to defend recently acquired political rights; and in particular, the new idea that Jews were citizens of the European """"""""states"""""""" in which they resided. In retrospect the giving of political rights to Western European Jewish residents was contingent on their ceasing to be Jews in the traditional sense; or in any sense at all. The “reform” movement, started in Germany, was an attempt to give religious imprimatur to these developments; including rejecting the re-establishment of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem; and thus naming synagogues “temples.” In the East, the Haskalah led to secular Jewish nationalism (e.g., Chaim Zhitlowsky's ideas); of which Zionism was just the most successful and consequential. However, even in the East, there were assimilationists who wanted to dissociate themselves from their heritage to gain approval of gentiles. The “Jew” that is the subject of antisemitism is an artificial construct of the Roman Catholic church; and has no connection to flesh and blood Jews. It was an attempt by Jews to distance themselves from the chimera of Christian theology that later morphed into racism, (invented to attack newly acquired Jewish political rights in Europe), that Jews were attempting, perhaps understandably, to distance themselves from. Even in America, there were references to “Hebrews” instead of “Jews”; in an effort to seek approbation from gentiles; and distance Jews from Christian mythology. (It should be noted that America’s, (i.e., the United States, but not Canada’s), offer of citizenship was genuine and not a quid pro quo.)

Storm of the month
Hurricane Frank is the storm of the Month.

Tropical Depression Nine-E formed on August 21 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It developed into a tropical storm the following morning. On August 23, Frank continued to intensify, but later faced shear and entered a period of weakening. However, on August 24, as shear decreased, it began to reorganize and strengthen again, becoming a hurricane on August 25. Two days later, Frank weakened into a tropical storm. Rapidly weakening overnight, NHC issued that it have been degraded into an remnant low. The area of low pressure associated with Frank was absorbed with another area of disturbed weather which later developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E.

Throughout Central America, Hurricane Frank produced torrential rain that resulted in at least 30 fatalities, most of which took place in Nicaragua and Honduras. In Guatemala alone, damage from the system was estimated to be up to $500 million. In Mexico, six deaths were reported. A total 30 homes were destroyed with 26 others damaged. Two major roads were damaged with another road blocked due to a landslides. Several rivers overflowed their banks as well.  Losses from the storms totaled millions of dollars. Water Currents form a nearby volcano were damaged as well.




Other tropical cyclone activity

Atlantic Ocean– In the Atlantic Ocean, around three storms and one depression formed. Tropical Depression Four early on August 2. Early the next day, the depression strengthened further into a tropical storm and was named """"""""Colin"""""""".  Tropical Storm Colin was downgraded to a tropical depression late morning on August 8. Tropical Depression 5 formed on August 10, with no improvement, it dissipated within 24 hours. Tropical Depression Six developed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 21, the first of the series of Cape Verde-type storms. On August 22 the system attained tropical storm status, thus earning the name """"""""Danielle"""""""" The next day it attained hurricane status, becoming the second of the season and strengthened further to a Category 2 hurricane. On August 27, Hurricane Danielle strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane of the season, and further strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane shortly after.Danielle later weakened to a Category 3, then Category 2 hurricane, and later became a Category 1 Hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle, while avoiding land areas. It became extratropical early on August 31 southeast of Newfoundland without having directly impacted land. It was fully absorbed by a larger extratropical low on September 4 over Greenland. On August 25, Tropical Depression 7 formed east of Hurricane Danielle. Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. On August 29, 2010 Earl strengthened to become the season's third hurricane. Earl then quickly intensified to become the season's second major hurricane on August 30. The hurricane weakened to a Category 3 hurricane after an eyewall replacement cycle before becoming a Category 4 again. Earl made landfall in the Canadian Maritime Provinces, twice in Nova Scotia and once in Prince Edward Island (PEI) at hurricane intensity. On August 30, when gale-force winds and better organization resulted in the development of Tropical Storm Fiona, skipping tropical depression status.

These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners.

"""""== Blood fetish ==
Regarding blood fetish: please don't suggest to people that:
 - a common way of finding out whether a person would be safe to engage in bloodplay with is for them to go to their local blood donation organisation, who check blood if it is safe and contains no diseases before it will be stored.
Using a blood donation organization as a proxy STD test is highly irresponsible; if the testing is not 100% perfect (and in never is), and the person trying this is positive (and presumably anyone who is considering doing this considers this to be entirely possible), they will almost certainly (because of pre-test blood pooling, and the very large blood volumes involved) infect one or more unwitting third parties with a potentially lethal disease.

Instead, they should get tested at their local sexual health clinic.    

People just wanting to make sure are no more likely to have an STD than other first-time blood donors.. I don't see your point: If that kind of carelessness goes on things would happen *anyway*  (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉) 

It's reasonable to assume that people who take part in high-risk activities are at higher risk than other members of the population. In epidemiology terms, it's assortative mixing among people with high risk tolerance; people who take part in one high-risk activity are more likely to take part in others, including taking part in these activities with multiple partners; and no, you can't trust your partner who tells you """"""""I've never done anything like this before, either"""""""". Consider the outbreaks of HIV in the regularly-tested adult movie industry; this in a population that take part in high-risk activities, and yet are all tested monthly.   

Hmm I guess that makes sense, kinda

I would be interested in reading if you feel like creating articles for """"""""assortative mixing"""""""" and """"""""risk tolerance"""""""" maybe  or   (Α⇔Ω ¦ ⇒✉)

I'm not familiar with the article or the subject of its concern, but I fail to see how saying """"""""X does Y"""""""" constitutes an actual endorsement of Y.  If such a method is indeed commonplace then, regardless of the advisability of such method for practitioners of said activity, it should be included as part of the article on that activity.   

Karada, I think you miss the point here.  Just because certain behavior is inadvisable does not mean Wikipedia should not state that people engage in it (if indeed they do) and describe it.  Certainly, the encyclopedia should not ENDORSE it (but then again, neither should it endorse anything elseNPOV and all that), but simply stating that it happens and describing what it is hardly constitutes an endorsement.  If we were to remove all content that describes inadvisable behavior, then we would also have to remove Collectivism, Fascism, Socialism, Christianity, Communism, Totalitarianism, Anarchism, Democracy, New England Patriots, Detroit Pistons, and Houston Astros.   

It's also worth noting that there are some bloodborne diseases that we can't yet test for.  (Prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease comes to mind.)  In addition to spreading these diseases to one's blood play partners, one would then potentially infect one or more innocent bystanders each time one donated blood.  Most jurisdictions also bar donations from individuals who have recently (in the last 12 months) come in contact with another person's blood.  Lying to the nurses when they ask about this stuff could conceivably make you civilly and/or criminally liable for any morbidity or mortality resulting from a tainted blood donation. (talk)

 From Wikipedia:Requested moves 

December 31, 2007
:Rock Band (video game) → Rock Band — There is no page at Rock Band or Rock band, as they're just redirects, hence no reason for the (video game) at the end. — (talk | contributions) 
Actually, there was an article at Rock band until somebody decided to merge it a couple of weeks ago (and that wasn't even a clear consensus). If anything, both should redirect to Rock music (which Rock band was merged with). So I don't think this is uncontroversial.  Spyke 
You beat me to the punch.  Clearly the term rock band is well used in the wiki and this needs to be discussed.  I think moving as proposed would be too confusing since the distinction is Rock Band v rock band.    
Dab That's what {{for}} is for. Simply put {{for|the genre of music|Rock music}} or somesuch. Either way, Rock Band should not redirect to Rock Band (video game). -·T·C·M 
Noting that a couple of thousand pages link to Rock band, and most of them refer to a group of people playing rock music, and not to a video game, I think we can't have Rock band redirecting to Rock Band (video game), as it now does. On the other hand, Far fewer pages link to Rock Band, and a higher proportion of them refer to the video game. Thus, as far as internal linking is concerned, it makes sense to have Rock band as a redirect to Rock music, and to move Rock Band (video game) to Rock Band, placing hatnotes on both articles. The alternative would be to have Rock band and Rock Band redirect to Rock music, and leave Rock Band (video game) where it is, with a hatnote at Rock music. The only reason to go with the second option would be if we think people are likely to type """"""""Rock Band"""""""" into the search box when they're thinking of bands playing rock music.  One other thing - why are we discussing this here, instead of at the article talk page? - 

I've just copied the above from WP:RM, where it was listed in the """"""""incomplete proposals"""""""" section. Consulting this talk page, a few sections up, it's clear that this page was just moved from Rock Band a little while ago, so before anybody decides to move it back, I thought I'd try to bring all the discussion to the same page. I would also direct the attention of anyone interested to Talk:Rock band, where I've left a comment about why that page really needs to say redirected to Rock music, unless someone does something about the 2300 broken links first. - """"",0,Wikipedia

"Request for reconsideration:  Deletion of Bullshido.net entry 

Requesting you re-examine the arguments in [], as per WP:DRV.

Your summary of my argument is factually false.  My argument was that the addition of four [more [reliable sources should carry weight.  The statement that the Real Fighter article was not neutral based upon some colorful language suggests your inexperience with publications about mixed martial arts.  Also, you gave us no time whatever to contact Sean Treanor and learn more from him; in any case, an article hosted on Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism webpage, and not on a student's personal website within stanford.edu, could hardly have failed to undergo peer review or professorial supervision.

Furthermore, regarding the Real Fighter article, , the President of the American Sambo Association, took time out of his day to inform the discussion about how the article got produced:

My name is Stephen Koepfer and I wrote the original Bullshido article/investigation on Geraci. I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.

This addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary. Nor did you mention Carol Kaur's well-reasoned argument, which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer.

The only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus.  If Bullshido's similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light, neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus.

I respectfully submit that your summary of consensus was factually wrong on several points, and ask you to reconsider.",0,Wikipedia

 THF 

I have not perused Wikipedia lately, but when I did, I saw some cooler (and sane) heads have seemingly prevailed, including yours.

THF was the first AEI director I had the misfortune to encounter.  When he saw my edits, which he didn't like, he came after me with a vengeance, and lobbied for me to be banned on Wikipedia.  He defamed me on his talk site (yes, I am aware of the meaning of the word, since I also am an attorney).   It was defamation - libel, to be exact -  and removed after a time, when I threatened suit.  I know Wiki doesn't like that - but it reaps what it sows.    THF  threatened me and my husband with frivolous litigation OUTSIDE of Wikipedia, and we called him on it.  We never heard from him again.
At that time, Wiki cliques would not or could not listen to what I had to say, and what had occurred.  I have no idea if I am """"""""banned"""""""" or not, and don't care at this point.  After the Kafkaesque experience, I never want to edit again here.  That said, I am grateful that you and it appears some others were able to expose him for what he is - even if it took a different issue entirely.  (I had no particular interest in the Michael Moore debate).

The AEI is one of the most powerful political influences in the Republican party.    THF was quite an eye-opener for me.  Rarely have I ever seen anyone so ruthlessly disparage others, with false """"""""information"""""""".  I can only guess what he does """"""""professionally"""""""".   THF is a public figure.  His attempt to hide out at Wikipedia claiming it was only a """"""""hobby"""""""" was laughable.  It was astonishing that anyone fell for it, but many did.

Good for you for calling him on it.  Maybe there is hope for Wikipedia, but I'm not holding my breath.""""",0,Wikipedia

"That is supposedly. However this article's content and Devdutt article s are very similar. And that is not just because they both are about Ashokasundari. The way these two articles is written is very similar. Also remember that a web portal sources its information from various sources even the news. Also you should know that 's article also appeared in Times of India. Should we use that as a source just because it appeared in a news website? Obviously not. All information must be verified.

His origins too are folk legends however the source I have used on his article clearly mentions he is a non Sanskritic deity. Also there is a folk tale about Shiva dancing nude to make Kali run away from a forest. However it is mentioned in a book that I read on Google. I am not at all against adding information about Ashokasundari to her article I actually in support of it. However the information should be first proved reliable and true without a doubt. Besides I think it is not such a big deal that the thing about the folk tale can't be added ,even if might be true (which is unlikely).

"""""Concerning one point of disagreement concerning policy formulation in the above discussion, I would suggest that the normal approach is:
Yes, knowing something to be untrue, is generally accepted as a reason to tag or remove material. In fact, the extreme argument, which I do not have much sympathy with, is that questioning un-sourced material is always acceptable, no matter what the intention. (But then people generally add some proviso when arguing this extreme version, such as """"""""except when we are talking about obvious behavior issues"""""""".)
Trying to formulate what less extreme people think, I would say that believing something to be unlikely to be something that people could come to a consensus about being true is a valid reason for tagging or removing material.
This is perfectly consistent with our real way of working: verifiability, the ability to confirm that something is what rational people could agree to be true, is our threshold for inclusion, but not personal opinions about what is true.

GA Sweeps Review: On Hold
As part of the WikiProject Good Articles, we're doing sweeps to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the GA criteria. I'm specifically going over all of the """"""""World History-Americas"""""""" articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a Good article. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed. I have made multiple corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and if progress is being made then the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Here are the points that need to be addressed:
Expand the lead to better summarize the article. It should mention a little bit about each heading within the article. The current two sentences isn't sufficient in describing the article. For guidelines, see WP:LEAD. The first paragraph in the background sections reads like part of the lead, consider rewording part of it and merging it into the current lead.
""""""""Many subsequent historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus either characterized Hamilton as """"""""suicidal"""""""", Burr as """"""""malicious and murderous,"""""""" or both."""""""" Single sentence shouldn't stand alone. Either expand on it or incorporate it into another paragraph. Go through the rest of the article and fix any other occurrences.
""""""""When the original pistol was examined, the concealed hair trigger was discovered. (Reference: """"""""Pistols shed light on famed duel,"""""""" Smithsonian magazine, November 1976)"""""""" This reference should be converted to an inline citation.
This is not required, but consider converting the url inline citations to the templates used at WP:CITET.

Needs inline citations:
""""""""The most famous duel in American history..."""""""" If this is going to be stated a citation needs to be included.
""""""""...partook in """"""""hooliganish"""""""" behavior in..."""""""" If """"""""hooliganish"""""""" is in quotation marks, then it needs to have a source directly after the sentence.
""""""""There, after much debate and tight gridlocking, the influence of Alexander Hamilton, a very respected Federalist persuaded Federalists that Jefferson was the lesser of two evils.""""""""
""""""""It claimed to describe """"""""a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr"""""""" at a political dinner.""""""""
""""""""In a letter delivered by William P. Van Ness, Burr demanded """"""""a prompt and unqualified acknowledgement or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper"""""""".""""""""
""""""""The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third false rib—fracturing it—and caused considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra.""""""""
""""""""...“Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at Col. Burr the first time”.""""""""
""""""""In addition, Hamilton had been reported as having severe mood swings, characteristic of a manic-depressive starting as early as 1800. If Hamilton was indeed manic-depressive, his intentions for dueling with Burr may have been psychologically delusional.""""""""
""""""""the same pair which had once shot a button off of Aaron Burr's coat some five years earlier during a duel with Hamilton's brother-in-law""""""""

Fair use rationale for Image:AlexKiddManga.png

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:AlexKiddManga.png. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"""""my contributions"""""""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"""""Image"""""""" from the dropdown box.

She gave conflicting evidence over when she took the photos, but as far as I know, she didn't initially deny she took the photos.

Maybe Tim could be the judge on what is the most suitable.

To understand why this is an error one has to read  which basically found that all DQA1*0501 previously type in Europe split 2 ways, DQA1*0501:DQB1*0201 and DQA1*0505:DQB1*0301 (I was scolded by a referee for not knowing this and not knowing DQA1*0505 and DQA1*0501

"In general, the reusable parts of fuel are long-lived and the parts that complicate reuse of spent fuel are short-lived.  In general, fuel becomes easier to reprocess over time, largely because less shielding is needed to protect against radiation from the decay of short-lived fission products.  One exception is the decay of Pu-241 (with a half-life of 14 years) to Am-241 (half-life 432 years).  Though the decay rate is much lower, the radiation hazard is higher because the decay includes a low-energy gamma ray.  Recycled fuel with higher Am-241 is therefore somewhat harder to handle safely.  Also, the Am-241 is not fissile and is therefore prone to absorb neutrons (in a standard light-water reactor) and produce higher transuranics rather than fission and produce energy and fission products, so the spent fuel is also harder to handle.

Fast reactors in principle can help reduce these problems, since most transuranics undergo fission in a fast neutron spectrum.  But fast reactors do not have a strong track record of reliability and carry a significant cost premium.  So in considering the economics of recycling, it's important to take into account not only the cost premium of the fuel but also the cost premium of the reactor needed to use the recycled fuel most effectively.",0,Wikipedia

Hi.
I was just wondering why you removed my edit on the Mackem rivalry page?  What I added, I believe to be a fact.  Perhaps we could work on making it more neutral if you thought it may offend anyone?  I am originally from South Shields, which is more or less equidistant from the rival cities.  I am currently however, living in Middlesbrough.  The rivalry in South Shields is slightly more noticable since it is geographically and socially directly in the middle, and also because it has more of a mix of Necastle United and Sunderland AFC supporters.  The rivalry is especially evident in the new town of Washington as it seems (I might be wrong) to have approximately an equal amount of Geordie and Mackem residents.

I don't want to offend anyone, however, I believe my edit should be included in the article in some form, as it is true that there are a considerable amount of people in both Newcastle and Sunderland who don't have a clue about the origins of the rivalry.  They tend to attribute it entirely on football, or in extreme cases, for no reason at all.  Sometimes, whenever a Geordie or a Mackem makes a reference to the rivalry, I question them.  Most of the time, their response was just """"""""don't know why,"""""""" or """"""""because they are scum!"""""""" and cound not give a reasonable argument.

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts!

Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty.

"Another Explanation of the Error

Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). 

Why?

Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.

See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often.

So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.",0,Wikipedia

 revision to chart 

I know it can be written that he was safe every week but go around to all the AI contenstant charts and you see the result of every week in the chart.   
Yea and they all should be changed. Just as we don't beat the obvious into people we don't need to state ___ has again gone another week. The info of what order they sang is also unhelpful. The lede clearly states he finished as the runner-up and we can give credit to our readers that they will realize that he didn't just sing those songs as a special guest. I'm not going to delete on all those other AI articles but I believe that should happen.   Banjeboi 
 So you think if someone wants to know if a contestant was safe they can go the American Idol season page?   
The chart is a supplement to the text which should be clear. The lede should state as of April 2009 ____ is a contestant. And when eliminated it states that info. Likewise with bottom three info, if it's relevant it will be in a reliable source - and OMG every bit of this stuff is covered - so we then cover it. _____ has never been in the bottom three or ____ has been in the bootom three twice before elimiation, etc. The order they sang? That seems likes it's original research or, sorry to say, fancruft, but not helpful on the biography articles. We have no reliable sourcing that the order impacts anything although it might. It ends up being as trivial as what they wore, their hair, who the friends were in the audience etc. If any of it is covered in reliable sources then maybe. Meanwhile the season article does a fairly good job of organizing the rest. Last year i took this article on and I guarantee it's been a non-stop effort to keep it cleaned up. Most people do have good intentions but there are a lot of fans who insert unhelpful bits. Sorry for not responding sooner but I do watch this",0,Wikipedia

I see that you are currently at the forefront of a dispute with Jake Waskett. The article linked here provides very interesting background about Mr Waskett.

Mr Waskett is not a scientist; he is somebody who has a sexual fetish. His contributions are in no way objective or unbiased. He pushes for undue weight to be accorded to data which appear to support his own bizarre position. Is there nothing that can be done to get him, and people like him, banned from Wikipedia?

"Thanks for the suggestion. I slept it over and hope that you are feeling more up to answering my questions about the edit in question. Specificaly: 

has the community not gotten smaller? 
was it not caused by the automobile? 
have I not sourced the statement as asked? 
is it not a fact? 
is it not information? 
does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was? 
is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between 1870 and present? 
is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not?

All that I'm asking is for you to explain why it is better to not have the statement than to have it. As far as I knew wikipedia is intended to contain the sum of all human knowledge. As someone who lives near Foresters Falls I find that this information answers a pertinant question left open by the article (Why is foresters falls so small if it once had lumber mills and such?) I know that you said you don't want to continue this dialogue but I hope that you can understand that my frustration comes from the fact that you have, so far, not explained yourself. from my point of view it seems that you made the edit on a whim and refuse to acknowledge the possibility that it may have been a bit unwarranted. I found the information in a book on local history, I have listed the book as a source as asked. What additional criteria need to be met? please tell me. If I were to refrase the sentance? Would that be better? In fact if you could tell me what criteria was used to determine that it should be removed that would be fine. Because I'm sure that this sentance is no worse (certainly not because it doesn't detract from the page in the first place) than any other statement on any other page. Why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement? Just because? Please answer this letter. Please do not throw another stock statement at me. Please do not respond to one statement I made in this letter and ignore any points you don't care to address. I would like you to meet me point for point and justify your actions. Please don't block me for daring to question administrators. Please don't interpret anything I have said here as a personal attack and ignore my entire post in favour of telling me not to post personal attacks. Please don't treat me like an ant under your feet who deserves no recognition.

I posted a new subject but don't know if I highlighted it this way. It's about the National Press Club and PRSA. Here's part of it with four tildes at the end. (jack@odwyerpr.com)

Hi Jim:
Thanks for your help in posting crucial material on WP.

The National Press Club, the largest, most prestigious press club in the world which has about 750 PR (""""""""communications"""""""") members in addition to thousands of journalists, on Oct. 19, 2011 issued a formal statement asking Public Relations Society of America to withdraw its ban against O'Dwyer Co. reporters at the 2011 national Assembly of the Society Oct. 15 in Florida. This ban had been stated in writing in a 23-page document of PRSA which NPC examined and rejected.

Whatever was in those 23 pages was not enough to bar O'Dwyer reporters from the Assembly (for the first time in 40 years), said the NPC statement which was signed by Mark Hamrick, president of NPC and a longtime reporter for the Associated Press. NPC does not want the lesson going out to the 31,000 regular and student members of PRSA and other PR people that the way to deal with critical press is to ban it from the group's meetings. The NPC did not agree with any of the charges against the O'Dwyer Co. or its employees that were in the 23 pages. It only noted that PRSA had made such charges.

To underscore its condemnation of the PRSA boycott, NPC sent its statement to 390 national and international media with offices in Washington, D.C. (That list is available if you wish it).

Below is the full text of the statement. If additional verification is needed, call executive director Bill McCarren at 202/662-7500 or e-mail him at wmccarren@press.org. At least one news medium published the statement.

Cordially,

Jack O'Dwyer (jack@odwyerpr.com)

 some advice 

hi Hboetes.   You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.

I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an """"""""encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""""""" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a """"""""body of law"""""""" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call """"""""wikilawyering"""""""")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as """"""""reliable"""""""" and """"""""NPOV"""""""" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. 

So don't edit war - discuss on the talk page. Ask authentic questions, not rhetorical ones, about what policies and guidelines are relevant to the content you care about.  good luck.   """"",0,Wikipedia

Also neglected is the fact that the North Korean population often takes the brunt of natural disasters from floods, mudslides, typhoons and other events due to poor infrastructure, planning and preparations.67.71.31.52",0,Wikipedia

 """"""""British Isles"""""""" 

Hi. Thanks for your note; I assure you that the detailed explanations you offered weren't necessary — for somebody who doesn't live in Ireland or in the UK, I think I have an excellent knowledge of the region.

Where I differ from you is in my understanding of the word """"""""British."""""""" To my ears, """"""""British Isles"""""""" is an ancient and 'unmarked' (to use some linguistics terminology) phrase; to my ears, the anamalous thing is the use of the adjective """"""""British"""""""" as though it were the proper adjective for the United Kingdom. It's not; when used as such it's imprecise shorthand. You call the phrase """"""""British Isles"""""""" Victorian; but of course it is much older than that; and the ancient origins of all this terminology vastly predates the modern political situation (even if we define """"""""modern"""""""" as meaning """"""""the past millennium"""""""").

The deeper question, of course, is whether you have a terminological objection or a geographical one— do you object merely to the phrase """"""""British Isles""""""""; or do you object to the whole notion that these particular islands can be considered together as a set? Because, see, I think it's pretty obvious at a geographical level (far before humans arrived to hurt each other's feelings) that the islands can reasonably be considered a group. But once we consider them as a group, we have to call them something. I don't think any alternative to """"""""British Isles"""""""" has much currency.

I understand that for some Irish people the phrase rankles; but if they think that the phrase, when used by people from the UK, is full either of arrogance or ignorance or triumphalist glee, I'm quite confident they're mistaken in thinking so. Certainly in the rest of the world, outside those two countries, """"""""British Isles"""""""" is a phrase used constantly and frequently by well-educated people who are fully aware of the two countries / two islands involved, and who have no emotional investment in their sometimes strained history.  |  talk """"",0,Wikipedia

Here is my proposed redraft of the intro paragraph to recognize the fact that things are in flux:
The Saskatchewan Party is a centre-right political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.  The party was established in 1997 by a coalition of former Progressive Conservative and Liberal members and supporters who sought to remove the New Democratic Party from power.  While it has been a conservative party since its creation, it is now attempting to attract centrist voters.  The Saskatchewan Party serves as the province's Official Opposition, holding 26 of the 58 seats in the province's Legislative Assembly in Regina.

A matter of fact

In 1987 The New Yorker magazine published an article written by Alec Wilkinson concerning one Jean-Pierre Ady Fenyo, a 23 years of age individual who would sit out in Greenwich Village and offer passersby Free Advice. In 1991 the first media reports about the three Free Advice Ladies began to appear. Why? Because, unbeknownst to the general public, Amy Alkon and her two colleagues Minnick and Johnson, had read the article in The New Yorker and figured they could make it appear to be their own original idea. Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence exists at The Official Free Advice Man Web-site.When the original Free Advice Man went back up to New York from Baltimore, where he was residing at the time, and confronted the three intellectual thieves, he asked them, without first divulging his own respective identity, where they had come up with the idea. Because they were not under the spotlight of a major mass media outlet they divulged the truth: """"""""...we read this article in The New Yorker and thought that this would be fun to do..."""""""". Nowhere, not on Oprah, not on CNN, or anywhere else, did these three persons inform the public that they were making their fame at the expense of someone else's idea.  """"",0,Wikipedia

"The SPLC’s Outright Telemarketing Scam
PUBLISHED BY MICHAEL OLANICH, ON MARCH 31ST, 2015
telemarketing2014

ONE MONTH ago, we gave the Southern Poverty Law Center the benefit of the doubt concerning their dubious telemarketing practices. Today, with the release of their 2014 IRS Form 990 tax report, we cannot cover for their outright telemarketing scam any longer.

On the right is the SPLC’s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2014.

For the fourth consecutive year, SPLC Founder Morris Dees, who bills himself as a “sound steward” of the donors’ money has deliberately scammed tens of thousands of well-meaning donors through his network of paid telemarketing rip-off artists.

To wit, for the past four years Mr. Dees has continued his relationship with Grassroots Campaigns of Boston, Mass, despite the horrific hemorrhaging of donor dollars. Grassroots has cost the SPLC hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars each year for their fundraising efforts:

2011:  -$212,214

2012:  -$869,686

2013: -$1,156,765

2014:  -$1,130,680

How in the world can Mr. Dees continue to deal with a company that has blatantly siphoned $3,369,345 donor-dollars out of his coffers over the past four years? These horrendous figures more than wipe out every dollar raised by his other telemarketing cronies, not that that amounted to all that much.

Checking out Telefund, Inc. of Denver, we see that they raised $561,102 in the name of the SPLC  in 2014, and only pocketed $422,292 in fees, leaving the SPLC $138,811, or a whopping 25% of the donation money.

Did anyone tell the donors that Telefund was pocketing three quarters of their donor-dollars?

But that’s all chump change compared to the experts at Harris Marketing group, who raised $213,694 in the name of the SPLC and “fighting hate,” and only pocketed $192,928, or a mere 90% of the money donated over the phone.

And yet, Morris Dees could not be happier with the results because Grassroots, Telefund and Harris all sold their information to him. For mere pennies on the dollar, Mr. Dees buys solid donor leads that he can feed into his own uber-efficient in-house fundraising machine at 100% profit down the road.

Best of all, it was the stupid donors who unwittingly paid to have their information sold to Mr. Dees. You really cannot beat that for “stewardship.”

Dees will lose money on the deal this year, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions he stands to gain from these donors over the coming decades.

But think about it. In 2014, Mo Dees paid $2,537,027 to third-party telemarketers to raise $1,979,272 in donor-dollars, meaning that the telemarketers kept every last dime they solicited over the phone in the name of the SPLC as well as an additional $557,755 out of the SPLC’s existing donor till

THIS is “sound stewardship?”  At $100 dollars apiece “only” 25,370 of the 2014 donors got screwed out of their donations. A mere pittance. At $50 dollars a pop the number jumps to more than 50,000 suckers, and yet, Mo Dees calls this “sound stewardship?”

Justify it anyway you want, but at least 25,000 well-meaning donors got screwed out of their money, just as they have for the past four years.

It’s time that the media and the IRS investigates the criminal scamming of the Southern Poverty Law Center. This is nothing less than blatant fraud. Selling the suckers one thing and giving them something far less.

Hi Jorgenumata. I liked all the additions you have made. I myself have worked in metals on the physics side, so I can add some things. But actually, for the overall structure, I think it would be useful to discuss some of the ways that MD is used in different fields on the talk page so that we can incorporate the different uses of MD more fully. Most people are focused on their on field, and don't see outside it (me included), so it is kind of hard to incorporate all the different things into one article.
The merge discussion with MM is an example. Metals cannot be modelled by force fields. They are completely incompatible with the force field view of molecules, and from reading the MM page, MM only uses force fields. So it seems impossible to merge the articles. Anyway, enoough of my blabbing. The things that I am interested in knowing are what/how MD is used in different fields.

Fluid/aerodynamics: Do fluid dynamics / aerodynamics people use the billiard-ball approximation of atoms to model fluids, and are these methods considered molecular dynamics if they consider each atom individually?
Metals: We don't use force fields. Generally, TBSMA or equivalent is the least accurate/most empirical that can be used. Tight-binding and ab initio are far more common. Anyway, I can add a lot of metals things myself, so don't need much input here.
Semiconductors: Again, force fields are not used. However, requires very different approximations to metal simulations. Again, I can add stuff to the article on these.
Chemists: What exactly do chemists study? Are the chemical reactions always studied within a solvent, or are they studied on isolated chemical compounds? Is it always important to correctly model the temperature and pressure, or are these secondary considerations in chemical MD simulations?
Bio: Similar to chemistry, are temperature and pressure important? Do proteins get modelled within the context of a solvent, or are conformations studied on the basis of a single protein molecule with no external interactions?
So, I'll try to add some metals and semiconductor things to the article, but I don't want to break the chem/bio side. Will come back in maybe a week and try to do some additions.  09:09, 21 November",0,Wikipedia

"Hi again, below is the edit I would like to make to the wiki page about me.  Pretty much all of the information is a matter of public record and pretty easily verifiable.  This is the same bio that is used by the university at which I am a professor.  In fact, I think thats how the edit may have gotten tagged as a copyright violation.  Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.  Here is what I would like to say:

Andy Brick is a prolific composer, conductor and symphonist.  In 2003 Brick set a historic milestone conducting the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in the world’s first symphonic game music concert at the Gewandaus, Leipzig Germany to a sold out audience of 2200.

He has served as the exclusive principle conductor and music director of the concert series leading repeatedly sold out performances from 2003-2008. In 2005 Andy was appointed music director of  the European concert series, “Heros of Imagination”.  This concert series featured new symphonic music written by Andy and performed by the Neue Elbland Philharmonie.  Brick also served as music director for the first Chamber Music Concert of the Kammerphilharmonie.  Brick has conducted over 70 game titles including Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Halo, and World of Warcraft with orchestras throughout the world including The Prague Symphony, The Czech National Symphony, The North Carolina Symphony, The Bratislava Symphony, The Moravian Philharmonic, The Filmharmonic of Prague and members of the New York Philharmonic and Detroit Symphony.

He has also scored various independent films including Uphill All The Way with Susan Sarandon and The Cine Golden Eagle award winning Chatham County.   In 2009 Andy was retained as senior orchestrator for the upcoming Broadway musical Verse of Fortune.

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"""""Eichmann's."""""""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)""""",0,Wikipedia

 Why did Saturn fail??? 

I came to this entry to find out why GM is having to close Saturn - obviously decreasing sales - but why did this occur???

But this article tells me . . . . . absolutely nothing about what went wrong at Saturn.  Another useless Wikipedia entry.  I guess I'll have to go someplace else to find out what happened to Saturn.

 List of prophets in intro 

Hey all.  The list of prophets was fleshed out to the closer to full list of known, accepted prophets.  I knwo this list has been kept short by agreement way back, so i'm putting this topic here to allow people to discuss which prophets should be listed, if any, and how many.  I believe there's a more comprehensive list elsewhere in the Baha'i articles which mention Hud, the prophet to the Sabeans, Noah, etc. all prophets that would have to go into a full list of """"""""prophets accepted by Baha'is"""""""".  I think it's all two long.  

My own view is that Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad make sense, because these are central prophets to religions that are typically seen as """"""""Abrahamic"""""""" religions.  Buddha is added (I suspect) to clarify that the religion is not outside of connection to Dharmic traditions either.  Obviously a full treatment of prophets, the nature thereof, and the relationships between them would be inappropriate in the lead paragraph.

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"""""Good Faith"""""""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"""""good faith"""""""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"""""assuming good faith"""""""" or """"""""positively contributing to the consensus"""""""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"""""Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""""""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"""""TALK"""""""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"""""general discussion"""""""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts.

I will not have my name dragged through the mud by power hungry men like you and Mr. Wales. I'll be joining the Citizendium project where I know freedom rules and there is more credibility and respect for scholorly efforts. I think there, my new AS degree (figure that out what it mean) will be of some utility. And to answer your question, yes I am studying for the next level, the bacculaureate and maybe for a master's degree. I'm studying in the psychology field, perhaps to become a psychologist practicing in public schools or what is called a Physician Assistant in the US. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_Assistant

Anyway, farewell sir. I don't plan to return after this message transmits. So whatever you do to this account, I don't care. Nothing matters to me anymore, nothing. Only God and eternity matter. And assisting and defending the abused here and other places is what I do. See you on Citizendium if you wish to drop in. My first act there will be to edit psychology related articles and those dealing with counseling theories and practice. Until then,",0,Wikipedia

THE FOLL0WING ENTRY HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY DELETED

− The All-Ukrainian so-called Non-government Organization “Human Rights Public Movement “Russian-speaking Ukraine” (Russian: Всеукраинская общественная организация «Правозащитное общественное движение «Русскоязычная Украина») was founded on 1 March 2008 in Severodonetsk, Luhansk region during the II All-Ukrainian congress of deputies of all-level councils, and registered on 10 August 2009 by the Ministry of Justice (Kiev).Its financial backers are unknown and is it considered to be a """"""""front group."""""""" of the Russian FSB.

This group advocates the continued domination in Ukraine of the minority Russian-speaking citizens through the extension of Russian language and culture; and extension of the authority of the Russian Orthodox Churchin Ukraine, over the Ukrainian Orthodox and Uniate Catholic and Baptist churches. The organization represents the re-estabslishment in Ukraine of The Black Hundreds (sometimes The Black Hundred), also known as the black-hundredists (Чёрная сотня, черносотенцы in Russian, or Chornaya sotnya, chernosotentsy). THese were imperialist ultra-Russian nationalist groups in the Russia empire in the early 20th century. The Bolsheviks labelled these extremists """"""""great power chauvinists.""""""""

'Major Activities − − Ensuring the continued domination of the Russian language and culture in Ukraine on the grounds that this must remain inviolable and inalienable;  Ensuring the implementation, protection and strengthening of constitutional and internationally recognized human rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine and minority population; confirming these rights to be inviolable and inalienable; − Securing Russian language to receive status of the state language + * Securing Russian language to receive status of the state language relevant to its role and importance in Ukrainian society; − − Promoting the concept of shared imperial Russian history as the ideological basis of continued domination of Russians in Ukraine;  Promoting the concept of shared history of Slavic nations, aimed at integrating Eastern European nations; − − Working for a division of Ukrai",0,Wikipedia

The culture of the Great Seljuq court was adopted by the Sultanate, therefore the Sultanate had the same court system. I cannot believe you're actually contesting this, since there are plenty of sources which describe the Persianate identity of the Seljuks as a WHOLE, be they Great Seljuks or Rumi Sultanates.

"""""I have found further evidence related to this big hoax.  

The same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual's fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author's wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! 

I do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don't know what course to take, and really don't have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax.

YOU PEOPLE ARE AT IT AGAIN.

He first started achieving major public notoriety in early 2007, when he made complaints of harassment at Columbia University, against students who allegedly called him a """"""""baby killer"""""""" for being in the military

No, he first made his complaints in early 2006. This gained him attention at Columbia. Then he wrote articles for a student newspaper, a military newspaper and on some right-wing blogs. That got him noticed by national right-wing media, i.e., Fox News. In late 2006, left-wing students publicized his pornography background. It was largely ignored.

Then he got the CPAC award on the same day that Ann Coulter made her comment about John Edwards. That caused the gay blogs to dig up what had been reported in late '06. The story of CPAC applauding Coulter while honoring a gay porn star and hooked spread to non-gay liberal blogs, and then to MSNBC's Countdown. That's how it became a national story.

In the ensuing controversy, it became public knowledge that Sanchez himself had been a performer in homosexual/bisexual[4] adult films in the early 1990s. The story became popular in the blogosphere, especially among homosexual bloggers who insinuated rumors about the details of Sanchez's past.

Sanchez appears in 38 gay porn movies. About 15 of them are originals, the rest re-compilations. Of the 38 videos, one is titled """"""""Bi Conflict,"""""""" but in that video Sanchez performs homosexual acts. Sanchez has never had anything other than gay sex on film. These are not """"""""homosexual/bisexual films."""""""" He is a gay porn actor who appeared in gay porn films for gay viewers.

There has been no """"""""insinuation"""""""" of """"""""rumors."""""""" Rather, there has been reporting of solid evidence. Sanchez prostituted under the name Excellent Top between 1999 and 2002, and operated the No Regrets Massage service, a front for prostitution, in 2004. He directly admitted prostitution in an appearance on the Alan Colmes show on March 8, 2007, and in an article published the same day on Salon.com

Sanchez revealed that Countdown never bothered to contact him before running the television report. Countdown sourced several gay blogs to complete the report, as well as committed left-wing ideologue Max Blumenthal who claimed that Sanchez was apart of a greater """"""""an underground railroad"""""""" for fallen gay right-wingers.

Calling Bluemental """"""""a committed left-wing ideologue"""""""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor script. It is an outrageous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. So is saying that Sanchez """"""""revealed"""""""" that Countdown """"""""never bothered"""""""" to contact him.

Critics charge that Sanchez has given conflicting statements about rumors from anonymous bloggers.

The use of the phrase """"""""rumors from anonymous bloggers"""""""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor, an is an outraegous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. First off, they are not rumors. Remember, the so-called """"""""rumors"""""""" have proven true. Secondly, most bloggers are anonymous. This does not by itself indict them or the information they provide, any more than a newspaper story without a byline indicts the newspaper that prints it.

In an op-ed piece in Salon.com, Sanchez likened porn to prostitution, he subsequently said he wanted to draw that same analogy on his first appearances on Colmes Radio show.""""""""[24]

First off, whatever he claimed that he had """"""""wanted"""""""" to do on Colmes is immaterial. The Colmes interview stands on its own. Secondly, he made the claim about what he """"""""wanted"""""""" to do on a blog. But this time, it was on a right-wing """"""""ex-gay"""""""" blog. Since when does Wikipedia elevation right-wing ex-gay blogs to a superior status? Some """"""""neutrality"""""""" you people show!

A later report by the same writer appeared on April 1, 2007, indicating that Sanchez was also being investigated by the Marine Corps for fraudulently soliciting funds from two organizations, the United War Veteran's Council and U-Haul, in order to fund a deployment to Iraq which he never actually made. Sanchez has denied the charges; saying that he never collected money from either organization.[25]

Excuse me, but Sanchez's denial of fraudulent solicitation is a non-denial. In fact, Sanchez admitted soliciting the money. Whether or not he collected it has no bearing on whether or not he solicited it. Those are two separate issues. Extortion doesn't have to succeed to be extortion.

There is a larger point to be made here, which is that Sanchez's various explataions have been a circus of multi-contradictions. It is not """"""""neutral"""""""" to split the difference. Facts are neutral. So report the facts. How hard is it to report the facts?""""",0,Wikipedia

 Section Head Dispute  (moved from Talk:James I of England) 

Lets not argue about and revert each other's section breaks, please.  And it looks like you both just violated WP:3RR. This is just not important compared to the content, and may get this article protected or something else. We all had enough contentious editing in the past. Lets continue a civil debate and, who knows, maybe even come to consensus.  Stranger things have happened. Thank you. —   

I agree. Though, for the record, I """"""""only"""""""" undid the insertion of a section break above my post 3 times, no more. I am not sure how to further this discussion though.

Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center? Most major malls have only one picture of the mall, and NorthPark Center, being not too notable nationwide, has 5. Shrek05 14:31 26 Jun 2006

While NorthPark may not (yet) be notable nationwide, I don't see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall, for this reason:  the mall is the largest in Texas (at 2.35 million square feet) and one of the five largest in the US (according to the International Council of Shopping Centers).  Consequently, the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion.  With the 1.4-acre Center Park in the middle, NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating, playing or relaxing.  At one time, shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher, the mall also held the distinction of being largest air-conditioned building in the entire world.
 

 picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong 

The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird (I'm using ver 1.5.0.4 under Windows XP).  It looks fine in Internet Explorer (v 6.0, same OS).  Looking at the page source, it seems like more of a problem with Thunderbird or the CSS for same, but I'm no web developer.  Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it.   

 Fountains 

It's been probably a year since I last visited, but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights, and another feature I can't describe well, sort of a mini-pond with a bridge. Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly. Incidentally, having looked at the existing pictures (only one of which is at all attractive or unique), I think we'd do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead. (I'd have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures; I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class (they thought I was some sort of corporate spy).

 Major Edit (3/26/2007) - Staff Email 

I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license, since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos.  What I got in return was neither photos, nor permission, but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff.  (A full copy of the email is provided )

Most of the email has been transplanted into the article, with a few exceptions, as some parts did not meet Wikipedia's standards of notability or NPOV.

The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark.  The information does not appear to be notable.

The introduction claims """"""""NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping mall’s in the United States"""""""" but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as #7 in the US, based on Gross Leasable Area.  The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data, rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Center's website.

  
There's still a lot that violates NPoV here. I slapped the neutrality tag on it.

"""""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""""""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"""""South Asian sensitivities"""""""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"""""greatness"""""""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"""""obnoxious"""""""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

Developing your user page - it is easy
Wikipedia is a megalopolis and like in any city, interactions are very important. I recommend that you develop your user page so that people who visit your page may know your interests and share in them. It could be a single line telling others of not only your name but what you like or a complex page with every single thing that interests you on it. This is a great way of building up work groups that facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge on articles, talks etc. Happy building!!!     talk 

Become a great editor through diligence
Being a member of  the welcoming committee on Wikipedia I encourage you to help Wikipedia in any way you can to 
increase human knowledge. If you have credible information about a topic with verifiable references please feel free to add to that topic. If there is no article on that topic, why not start it, with time others will add to it and it may even make the featured articles list. By doing this, I have been able to make over 6000 page edits in both new articles, article improvement etc. Furthermore, I encourage you to aim to be a member of the  autoconfirmed users 
[] group as this will greatly improve your Wikipedia 
experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.    talk 

Adding media to  articles
Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.     talk 

Spotting bad edits and vandalism
As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of 
spotting them:
by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits
verifying new changes to pages and articles
If you happen to come across a bad edit you may:
ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs
you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad
request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page.
Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes.    talk """"",0,Wikipedia

You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are """"""""inaccurate"""""""", and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull.

Hi Lulubyrd, would you be so kind as strike out or remove your post for the reasons I explained in the ANI thread? (Reader's digest version: because it's not true, I even gave you a diff, and because I'm bothered you'd say such things). If you would do, then perhaps I owe you an apology for not WP:AGFing and assuming you wouldn't. It's not like our paths will cross very often, if ever, but why not score another friend?

Like you said in the article talk, the sources I cited didn't support """"""""Sabbatic Witchcraft"""""""", and... hey now, believe it or not, I was aware of that. You are welcome. Polemics make it difficult to communicate effectively.. there was no dispute, and no good options... but if you had renamed the article Sabbatic Craft, no one would have undone it. Better still, if you had suggested deletion and mentioned there was already a writeup in Contemporary witchcraft, I would have been behind that 100%, (even just mentioning the latter, I'd have suggested the former), with redirect 'natch.

""""""""Sabbatic Current"""""""" works ok as a section header, but because it's so obscure, it couldn't be used for the article per the guidelines for WP:TITLE, and while """"""""Sabbatic Craft"""""""" would have been better in that regard, it's supposed to be proprietary—the kanundrum... In addition to struggling with the guideline, I was trying to find a way to go by what Chumbley said too... and that's consistent with what you thought WP should do, yes?

Do you have any concerns with the redirects for Sabbatic witchcraft and Sabbatic Craft?

It's a sure bet you know way more about Sabbatic Craft than I intend to learn. What did you think of the changes I made to Contemporary witchcraft#Sabbatic Current? Is there a particular section in the Chumbley article that would be good to point the Cultus Sabbati redirect to? (My impression was none in particular, but I only read it once through).

 about your comment on Elaragirl's talk page 

Hello Dev920, I couldn't help but notice your comments on  talk page under the heading """"""""Esperanza"""""""", so I'm sorry if you feel this was an intrusion of your privacy (or Elaragirl's). I wanted to remind you that there is a spectrum of individual editors who claim affiliation with Esperanza, and some editors, how shall I say this? contribute less towards the mainspace than others.  As for the governance issue, I personally don't understand the current structure and I don't feel as if they exert any influence on me at any rate.

I still think that an off-Wikipedia coffee lounge that has an obvious link on Esperanza's page is the best way to satisfy those users who like to spend their time in the lounge, and still address the concerns of those who are opposed to its presence on Wikipedia. What's one more click of the mouse? Just so you know, I had participated a little in the coffee lounge, but I got turned off of it because of the random dog barking and a series of dirty jokes which I felt were sexist, offensive, and not at all belonging on Wikipedia. Because I had participated only to a limited extent, my overall edit count (2971 as of ) wasn't seriously affected when the coffee lounge was deleted.

I had proposed a hypothetical merger between Esperanza, the Kindness Campaign, and Concordia, and while I still think that many of their stated goals overlap, I also feel that Esperanza needs to better define itself before even considering such a merger, and feedback must be solicited from members of all three groups. I was unaware that Esperanza had a prior history of attempting mergers in the past. If you feel that my suggestion was naive and arrogant, chalk it up to my own shortsightedness, not to Esperanza as a whole.

I know that we may differ in our views of what to do with Esperanza, but at least the MfD and in particular comments by you, Elaragirl, and others, have given the impetus for Esperanza to examine itself. Thank you for that.

Since I've typed this much, I might as well invite you to review me at editor review. Thanks again for your participation in all of this.  """"",0,Wikipedia

 What is Linga? 

What is the Linga? And what is the meaning of the symbol? There are few ways to explain the meaning and the symbol of Linga.

1. Linga as Arthabrahma or phenomenal manifestation

Linga is the amorphous representation of Shiv and can be regarded as the highest emblem of Shiv because of its least anthrophomorphic nature. Shiv, Parabrahman, is the highest Divine Principle in intimate union with Divine Power, the Parashakti. The only positive qualities of this Divine Principle are Shat, Chit, and Anand. He is conscious of Himself i.e. He has Atmavimarsha. He is the cosmic Purusha (person) but is Nirakar - has no particular form and has no distinguishing mark. He is therefore inconceivable. """"""""God cannot be known by the mind or the physical senses"""""""" is consensus of all the sages. It is in this sense Herbert Spensor speaks of God as """""""" Unknown and unknowable."""""""" What he means is that Deity per se is """"""""Unknown and Unknowable."""""""" John Fiasco further argues that """"""""Deity is unknowable to the extent of it is not being manifested to consciousness through the phenomenal world knowable but knowable in order of its phenomenal manifestations: knowable in a symbolic way as the power of being rhythmic life of the universe; knowable as eternal source of moral law."""""""" If we accept this, then Shiv is inconceivable. But if He is not conceived, how can he be worshipped? Yet religious mind craving for eternal happiness cannot be satisfied without worship and cannot do without worship. He, therefore, requires some kind of representation or symbol of God. Without some concrete symbol of God, God would be a formless abstraction devoid of meaning to him/her. Hence it for those, who cannot digest abstract ideas of God, temples are built and images representing Gods in different powers and attributes are consecrated. Whatever may be said against images in the temples, rituals, and ceremonies, the fact remains that they are indispensable at a certain stage of the spiritual evolution life. 

Nirakar Shiv is Amurtha (formless) in his indistinct condition, and is Murtha or Sakar in his manifest condition –manifest in the form of universe. Shiv assumes eight-fold forms and is, therefore, called as Ashtamurthi. Then the Linga represents the whole universe appearing hemispherical placed on something. The Linga, the amorphous symbol of Shiv, thus, represents the Murtha form of Shiv. Hence, the Linga signifies Alinga or Shiv that has no special form or mark. The circular base with round semi-spherical top placed on it fits the description of the idea of Murthavthva.

2. Linga as Shabdabrahma

Shivaparabrahman is the cosmic Purusha having Atmavimarsha. He first vibrates in his Leele (play or amusement) towards creation. The vibration is Nada (a loud roar), the first expression as Nama or name. From his Nada proceeds Bindu (dot), i.e. the form. The couplet Nama and Rupa or Nada and Bindu are known as Onkara or Pravana. The Bindu is the disc-like Peetha and Nada is the line that supervenes the Peetha. The line stands on the Bindu like a cylinder with a rounded top. All this forms the Linga.

3. Linga as the Visvarupa

Shivaparabrahman has no particular form but is all-formed. He is, therefore, called Visvarupa. He is the creator of the Universe and assumes all forms in the Universe. He is hidden in all creatures, and pervades all and forms inner souls of all. He is said to have a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He has hands and feet in all directions. The semi-spherical top that supervenes the circular base represents this description of cosmic Purusha, with whom His devotees identify Shiv. The round top on the circular base really consists of thousands of heads, each of the size of a point. The sides of the cylindrical figure represents equally thousands of heads, eyes, and faces in all directions. The semi-spherical top, resembling the visible horizon, is truly symbolical of the universe that surrounds the earth on all sides. Though the symbol has no eyes and feet, or eyes and ears, it has thousands of hands and feet, heads, eyes, and ears in all directions, just as a circle has no face all around but it has faces in all directions at every point of the circumference. Thus the Linga is the closest possible representation of such formless or all-formed God Shiv. 

It is customary in nature that all classes of things in universe must have different shapes and forms. The so-called """"""""Gods class"""""""" must have different shapes and forms, though nobody knows what those shapes and forms should be. It is only the fancy of the human beings that has endowed Gods with some anthrophomorphic forms. But there is no proof of that. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that Gods have shapes and forms different from those of human beings as human beings have shapes and forms different from those of other animals,",0,Wikipedia

My Reply
Rjecina, calm down. Please, read my postings carefully, I have never said that Vlahs did not exist. Your comments are ludacris and off topic.  

Zenanarh, thanks for the reply. I have read the link that you have posted about the term vlah. The website is called """"""""G-d, Bosnia and Bosniaks"""""""", so i took all of the information describing Serbs with a grain of salt. I did enjoy reading the article, it  definietly had a lot of information that could be incorporated into the article (if there is another source backing it up). I have two major concerns. Firstly, the article concentrates on the Bosnian side Vlah's and not the Croatian side (the article is Serbs of Croatia not Serbs of Bosnia). Secondly, the article concludes with """"""""...when one hears... Russian politicians talking about the need to defend their ancient Slav brothers in Bosnia, that the one component of the Bosnian population which has a large and identifiable element of non-Slav ancestry is the Bosnian Serbs."""""""" I do not know how accurate the article is because of the last statement (in my opinion it leans towards the Muslim side). Also, inside the article there is a mention that Serbian scholars identify the term Vlah with shepards. Irrespectively, I think the article link was a great contribution.

After reading the article, the Bosnian Vlah's were """"""""settled"""""""" by Ottomans. Conversely, Croatian side Vlah's """"""""escaped"""""""" Ottoman prosecution. This was a mistake in """"""""Serbs of Croatia"""""""" article, which stated that Vlah's were settled by the Ottomans in Croatia.""""",0,Wikipedia
"And you're misinterpreting nearly everything I say. I never said he lied about what he did, only that I think he lied about his reasons for what he did. Nevertheless, I acknowledged that you thought that the reasons he stated were his only reasons and included that, but you seem to refuse to acknowledge that there is any possibility that there's more than one valid interpretation and instead of working with me just revert every edit I make. Sigh. Look we're both too close to this. Let's just back off and leave the article alone for a week (barring new episodes and vandalism).

Attention: Sandra [[User:69.11.10.188|

When indicating """"""""passing"""""""" in your statement above, could you please respond to the following questions re:the various registries you have referenced:

1)What do you mean by """"""""passing"""""""". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries """"""""enforce"""""""" these requirements?

2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these """"""""passing"""""""" grades?  Your """"""""grades"""""""" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?

3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?

4) Most importantly, since the term """"""""required"""""""" calls for a resource by which adherence to this """"""""requirement"""""""" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through """"""""blind trust"""""""") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.

In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip """"""""grades"""""""" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?  
 
Example: 

NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org""""""""
      AND
ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  """"""""
      AND
TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.
 
4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.

If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.

Thank you very kindly. M.Dùfy

I'm a religious Muslim and I don't care what anyone does or say against ISLAM because they're are people that are just too dumb to even waste your time on. Being hated because of my religion doesn't have any effect on me.

 Rescue 

The reason I spend my time rescuing articles, even ones that paid editors have apparently been involved with, is because 1) the intention is to transform the article into something neutral and non-promotional, which is better for Wikipedia than no content at all if the subject is appropriate for inclusion, 2) it doesn't actually matter what paid editors work on because that doesn't change what sources do or don't exist on that subject nor does it change editors' ability to appraise those sources and 3) Even though I am against paid editing, I dislike the idea of deleting articles on the basis of a paid editor having been involved with them when there is potential for improvement.  This feels like AfD being used as a vehicle for doling out punishment for unconstructive editing behaviors, which is what blocks are for, not AfD.   drop me a line (note: not a bot!)
